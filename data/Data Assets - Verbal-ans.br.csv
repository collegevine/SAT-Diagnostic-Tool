1,C,5,Literature Passages,,,"Choice C is best. Early on in the passage, lines 19–23 reveal the narrator’s initial unease and anxiety that is only underscored by the doubt highlighted in lines 35–36.​ ​Later, the use of the word “submit” in line 72 exemplifies the narrator’s intention to accept his own passions and desires.</br>It’s NOT Choice A because the narrator’s discomfort with the experiment never escalates into fear, only anticipation. Similarly, the concluding paragraphs provide no explicit evidence for excitement despite their change in tone.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the narrator never displays a lack of confidence in his ability to succeed with his creation. The narrator’s implicit contrast between the so-called “fools” described in lines 29–33 and his stated “full comprehension” in lines 34–35 eliminates this answer choice.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the narrator never takes a disapproving stand on his own attempts at his endeavor. While the narrator does question his true intentions briefly in lines 35–36, he does not come close to truly criticizing himself at any point."
2,D,3,Literature Passages,Supporting Evidence,,"Choice D is best. While it is somewhat ironic that an answer choice advocating for a loss of equanimity is supporting a tone of acceptance, the keyword here is “relinquish.” The narrator argues that he must allow himself to lose his calmness, which indicates acceptance of his growing obsession.</br>It’s NOT Choice A because lines 10–13 only indicate that the “dream” is the narrator’s obsession. They offer no clues regarding his attitudes towards it.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because while lines 23–29 provide hints about the narrator’s initial dread and unease about his obsession, they give no sense of a tonal shift that indicates an eventual acceptance of it.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the narrator’s contemplation about his motivations for the project gives us no sense of his change in tone from unease to acceptance."
3,D,5,Literature Passages,Words in Context,,"Choice D is best. It is crucial to identify “anachronistic” and not “abhorrently” as the key word of this phrase. Lines 1–3 also provide support for this answer choice, for even without knowing the dictionary definition of “anachronistic,” the comparison to a memory of a childhood friend offers clues that the phrase is most correctly understood as a reference to an earlier time period.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because while “abhorrently” could mislead the reader to this answer, the description of the desire as also “intimate” in line 4 makes this answer choice too directly contradictory to be correct.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because this is not synonymous to either word of the phrase.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because this is not synonymous to either word of the phrase. "
4,C,3,Literature Passages,,,"Choice C is best. L​ine 16 describes the narrator’s “prodigious and depraved desire for the truth,” and it is thus clear that the main purpose of the sentence is to emphasize the extent to which the narrator is driven by his own atypical motivations.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because there is no evidence that the author desires to share this side of his personality.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because if anything, the author’s decade-long focus on the problem reveals a meticulous and unyielding approach to scientific problems.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because there is no mention of financial constraints or expenditure in the sentence."
5,A,3,Literature Passages,,,"Choice A is best. L​ines 29–33 provide direct evidence for this answer choice, for in this sentence, the narrator characterizes the past failures of others as caused in part by their “scholastic arrogance.”</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because the narrator is disparaging of these past scientists and describes them only as failures.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the narrator never claims that the previous scientists failed in their ​design​ of the experiment.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the previous scientists have attempted the “same feat” that the narrator now undertakes, which clearly implies that they share the same goals."
6,A,2,Literature Passages,Supporting Evidence,,"Choice A is best. Lines 29–33 provide direct evidence for this answer choice, for in this sentence, the narrator characterizes the past failures of others as being caused in part by their “scholastic arrogance.""</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because lines 38–42 do not mention previous scientists and provide no evidence for why their previous attempts failed.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because lines 53–57 focus only on the narrator, not mentioning previous scientists and why their attempts failed.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because lines 64–68 focus only on the narrator, not mentioning previous scientists and why their attempts failed."
7,B,5,Literature Passages,Fact Recall,,"Choice B is b​est​. I​t is clear from the narrator’s characterizations of his ultimate goal as “the culmination of [his] lifelong fantasies” (line 23) and of his obsession as sustained by his “desire for the truth” (lines 13–16) that he finds his pursuit seductive. That he also believes it to be immoral is evident from descriptive phrases like “warped desire” (line 2), “depraved desire” (lines 15–16), and “perverse desire” (line 57). The immorality of the undertaking is furthermore hinted at in the inevitable negative public reaction described in lines 49–53.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the narrator clearly believes the experiment to be possible (and even likely successful).</br>It’s NOT Choice C because there is no evidence that the narrator finds the project intimidating. Nervousness does not necessarily insinuate intimidation.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because line 68 directly contradicts the idea that the experiment is “scientifically critical” by describing it as having “no practical use."""
8,D,3,Literature Passages,,,"Choice D is b​est​. ​By casting doubt that a restored corpse may not feel, love, or remember, the narrator implies through these questions that a restored corpse may not experience traditional human sentiments.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because no lines in the entire passage mention newborn humans.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because while this may be true, the questions posed by the narrator do not support a contention that the experiment must be more difficult than other experiments.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the narrator is clearly considering the implications of his experiment, and while this fact alone does not necessarily invalidate the truth of the claim in choice C, it is clear that the questions do not s​upport ​this line of reasoning."
9,D,3,Literature Passages,Words in Context,,"Choice D is best. As used in this context, “to take the utmost interest” is to commit fully to the pursuit in question, or to pledge to care deeply about it.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “to take interest” is almost completely opposite in meaning to “ignore responsibility.”</br>It’s NOT Choice B because this answer choice ignores the emphasis made with the use of “utmost” in line 61.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “pay little attention” is also nearly opposite in meaning to the idea of “utmost interest.”"
10,A,2,Literature Passages,Words in Context,,Choice A is best. The mention of “no practical use” in line 68 underscores the meaning of “fruitless” as indicating uselessness or impracticality in the real world. Only answer choice A comes close to satisfying these requirements.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “logical” is not synonymous to “fruitless.”</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “impactful” is an antonym for “fruitless.”</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “meaningful” is an antonym for “fruitless.”
11,D,5,Social Science Passages,Fact Recall,,"Choice D is best. ​Lines 9–15 make clear that the manufacturing industry is declining in size as gains in “specialized sectors” are outweighed by the losses in “competitive sectors.” Additionally, the mention of employment declines in line 42 makes clear that manufacturing is currently shrinking in size. However, lines 6–7 and later references to successful recovery from the recession establish that employment is on the rise.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because this answer choice is directly contradicted by lines 3–6.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because while lines 16–17 argue that “raw employment numbers are an ineffective, blunt instrument,” it is an illogical generalization to conclude that
the 2010–2017 economic statistics are unreliable.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because while the size and employment of the manufacturing industry may indeed be distinct phenomena, this is a point made in later paragraphs, such as in lines 83–87, and is not a point of the first paragraph."
12,D,3,Social Science Passages,Fact Recall,,Choice D is best. ​Lines 22–25 directly support this contention by mentioning medical devices as an example of the “cutting-edge technology” currently experiencing manufacturing expansion.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because lines 9–11 directly contradict this answer choice.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because lines 9–11 directly contradict this answer choice.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because lines 9–11 directly contradict this answer choice.
13,A,4,Social Science Passages,Words in Context,,"Choice A is best. “N​ascent,” by definition, is closest in meaning to ""young."" Additionally, the context of the sentence, “formed in the years before the late-2000s” implies that these industries have only existed for 10–15 years.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “older” is not synonymous to “nascent.”</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “small” is not synonymous to “nascent,” although the two may be highly correlated.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “obscure” is not synonymous to “nascent.”"
14,B,4,Social Science Passages,,,"Choice B is best. Note that the question asks to describe the ​current financial situation at many manufacturing companies. Lines 43–49 are the most relevant for determining the correct answer choice to this question — they directly suggest that current financial problems are the result of past obligations to unions.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because there is no e​xpected b​oom in profitability, even if there may be (weak) evidence that such a boom is possible (lines 55–58 may be a misleading justification for answering this question).</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the passage never states that current demand from domestic consumers is higher now as compared to before. If anything, lines 75–76 (“it exported far less than it does today in a world of free trade”) even hints at the opposite.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because there is no mention of poor management practices in the passage or an argument asserting that such practices incite weaker stability."
15,A,3,Social Science Passages,Supporting Evidence,,Choice A is best. Note that the question asks to describe the ​current f​inancial situation at many manufacturing companies. Lines 43–49 are the most relevant for determining the correct answer choice to this question — they directly suggest that current financial problems are the result of past obligations to unions.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because lines 49–50 sans context neither identify the problem nor describe the current financial situation.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because lines 50–53 present a conclusion based on the answer to question 14 but do not provide a justification for it.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because lines 55–58 do not support the answer choice to question 14.
16,C,3,Social Science Passages,,,Choice C is best. Lines 71–76 describe the many ways in which the past U.S. manufacturing industry was less productive than that of the current economy.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because line 72 explicitly contradicts this claim.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because lines 74–75 and 81–83 contradict this claim.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because there is no textual evidence that manufacturing in 1975 was experiencing declines.
17,C,3,Social Science Passages,Supporting Evidence,,Choice C is best. Lines 71–76 describe the many ways in which the past U.S. manufacturing industry was less productive than that of the current economy.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because lines 61–65 contain no information about physical output levels and productivity.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because lines 65–68 contain no information about physical output levels and productivity.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the information presented about manufacturing employment and factory closures does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that manufacturing in 1975 produced less output than in 2017.
18,A,3,Social Science Passages,Words in Context,,"Choice A is best. Business “conducted” should be interpreted here as business that each sector of manufacturing was part of or involved in. “Carried out” most closely maintains that meaning.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because new areas of business were not being created.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “prioritized” unnecessarily restricts “conducted.” </br>It’s NOT Choice D because lines 71–76 describe elements of the business that were being done, not business that was being regulated."
19,B,5,Social Science Passages,Data Analysis,Author-Based Questions,"Choice B is best. While the information in the chart may indeed be accurate, it is too vague and general to be useful. Additionally, the percentages presented in Figure 1 would fail to be of use in supporting any of the author’s claims in the passage.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the chart’s information provides no evidence for the arguments in the passage.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the numbers do not obviously contradict any of the author’s arguments or main tenets.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “fascinating” is too generous of a characterization and because there is no reason to suspect that the information presented is not up-to-date."
20,A,2,Social Science Passages,Data Analysis,,"Choice A is best. F​igure 2 makes this answer choice relatively straightforward. Levels of manufacturing value across every sector are clearly higher for 2017 than for any other year provided in the graph.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because the chart seems to show a slower growth, both proportionally and in absolute terms, for low-value manufacturing than for high-tech manufacturing.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the chart unambiguously displays an increase, not a decline, in the value of raw materials manufacturing.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because low-value, for instance, is clearly more valuable in 1995 than high tech is in 1995."
21,A,3,Social Science Passages,Data Analysis,,"Choice A is best. B​y looking at Figure 2 and comparing the 1995 and 2017 values for both raw materials and vehicles, it is clear that raw materials grew more over that period of time.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because the growth of low-value manufacturing was the slowest of all.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the growth of raw materials manufacturing was greater than the growth of low-value manufacturing.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the relative growth of high-tech manufacturing was lower than other areas."
22,A,4,Science Passages,,,"Choice A is best. The passage focuses mainly on the successful medical applications of 3D printing, and thus answer choice A is the most appropriate.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because the author never specifically mentions the history or future of 3D printing.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the passage’s main point is not to explore the science behind how 3D printing works. While it does elucidate the workings of a 3D printing press, the passage’s main point is to explore the products of printing, not examine how it derives its functionalities.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the passage neither focuses on only one research experiment, nor does it analyze any findings in detail."
23,C,3,Science Passages,Author-Based Questions,,"Choice C is best. T​he author is clearly enthusiastic about 3D printing and appreciative of its potential. The entire tone of the passage is positive and the content only mentions the technology’s successes.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the author does not raise any skepticism or worries about 3D printing.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the author is optimistic about 3D printing, not sad or depressed.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the author doesn’t obviously identify with those involved with 3D printing; rather, the author is more likely an enthusiastic reporter on the outside of the field looking in."
24,C,2,Science Passages,Words in Context,,"Choice C is best. “​Advanced” here is used in a sense of 3D printing having p​rogressed​ the medical industry. Thus, answer choice C is the best.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because 3D printing has brought about more tangible effects than merely encouragement.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because it does not make sense to argue that 3D printing “hastened” or “hurried” the medical industry without knowing to where the industry was hastened.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “provided” does not make sense without knowing what was being provided to the medical industry."
25,B,4,Science Passages,Fact Recall,,"Choice B is best. The characterization of the move away from metal and plastic as a “breakthrough” in line 44 implies that metal and plastic are not the best materials to use as ink. Furthermore, lines 62–67 reinforce the idea that the original approach of melting metal and plastic is inferior to certain new approaches. Finally, in lines 10–12, the author mentions that plastic or metal are typically used for 3D printing in medicine, so it is implied that these materials are still useful though not the most cutting-edge available.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because this statement is too extreme. The author never argues that metal and plastic should eventually never be used for prosthetics.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because there is no discussion anywhere in the passage regarding how cost-effective metal and plastic may be.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the approaches of the Chinese researchers described as “breakthrough” clearly indicate the existence of superior alternatives to metal and plastic."
26,C,3,Science Passages,Supporting Evidence,,"Choice C is best. Lines 35–40 argue that the advantages of 3D printing are already being manifested, which necessarily includes the metal and plastic approach. However, the new breakthrough that is predicted to “revolutionize the industry” suggests that the traditional approach must not be the “best,” or most optimal, approach.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the melted ink described in these lines provides no justification for why metal and plastic are not the best materials.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the benefit of prosthetics described holds no information as to whether better materials than metal and plastic exist for 3D printing.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because just because metal and plastic have h​istorically​ been used as the “ink” does not necessarily mean they are not the best choice."
27,A,5,Science Passages,,,"Choice A is best. Lines 69–72 provide direct evidence for this answer choice.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because their benefits seem relatively established, especially considering the example in lines 72–74 describing the successful transplant of the artificial bone into a live rabbit.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because this statement is too strong. While the transplant was described as successful, one cannot conclude from this information that the artificial bone represents a “perfect” replacement for real bones.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because there is no mention in the passage of possible complications when transplanted."
28,B,4,Science Passages,Supporting Evidence,,Choice B is best. Lines 69–72 directly reference the bone’s biodegradable and structural benefits.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because lines 60–62 offer no insights as to the qualitative characteristics of the artificial bones.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the description of the rabbit’s ability to grow natural bone cells on the artificial bone provides no evidence for the bone’s biodegradability.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because lines 80–83 contain no details whatsoever about the artificial bone. 
29,D,4,Science Passages,Fact Recall,,"Choice D is best. As described in lines 67–69 (“With the UV...range of materials”), the UV light method unlocked possibilities to 3D print many new medical objects and objects with more practical medical benefits.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the authors never insinuate any risk with the UV method in the passage.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the authors do not mention any additional power with the method, only an increased array of options for printing materials.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the authors do not suggest any limitations for the UV method. Rather, the UV method expands the options for 3D printing use."
30,D,2,Science Passages,Author-Based Questions,,"Choice D is best. The parenthetical is included to inform the reader of the ultimate testing goals of the artificial bone, i.e. for human benefit.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because even if this is true, the parenthetical in no way contributes to describing this similarity.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the passage never argues against the potential benefits of artificial bone prosthetics. On the contrary, the tone of the passage is one of enthusiasm.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the passage treats animal testing as a necessary stepping stone to human testing, which it considers to be a positive development. If anything, the parenthetical supports animal testing."
31,D,2,Science Passages,Words in Context,,"Choice D is best. “​Treasure trove” immediately brings to mind the idea of financial reward. The company’s characterization as a treasure trove for ​investors s​pecifically implies that these investors will be buoyed by the incredible success of the company and rewarded with soaring financial gains.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because there is no evidence as to the amount of time it took investors to find this company.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because while this may be true, the term “treasure trove” offers no reflection of the difficulty inherent to the breakthrough.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because there is no guarantee that the researchers will be viewed with respect by the medical community. The passage only mentions the effect on investors."
32,D,4,Historical Passages,Dual Passage,Author-Based Questions,"Choice D is best. ​Paragraph two holds the key to answering this question, as it describes what happens to men and women in the time after they finish their education. Men “leave school and plunge into life” (lines 7–8) while women “finish their education, come home, and stay at home. That is enough.” (lines 8–10). The rest of this paragraph then goes on to describe how many women “have an abundance of time and nothing to occupy it” (lines 16–17). While men can plunge into life, women are expected to stay home and do nothing except fall in love. Men’s lives are interesting and adventurous, while women’s lives are uninteresting and sheltered; they differ in scope and rigor. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because men’s and women’s lives ​do​ differ greatly in substance; men are expected to go out and experience life, but women are expected to stay home. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because while scope is correct, as in choice D, “severity” makes this answer choice incorrect. “Severity” reflects the degree to which their lives are different in an unpleasant sense—in seriousness or gravity. That is not the case here. Their lives are ​substantively​ different. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because “minutiae and particulars” signifies differences only in small, unimportant details. Throughout the passage, the author describes a difference much more meaningful than that."
33,B,3,Historical Passages,Dual Passage,Words in Context,"Choice B is best. The meaning of “society” here can be derived from the surrounding tone and context: “He delights to give them all they can desire — clothes, amusements, society. He and mamma together take every domestic care off their hands” (lines 13–16). Society generally means a group of people in a community, and given the description of women’s lives throughout paragraph three (“morning visitors,” ”every friend’s house they can think of,” “dance him defunct at all sorts of unnatural hours,” etc.) an elite social circle is the best definition for “society” in this passage.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “the company of one friend” is too narrow—two people together would not constitute a society.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because while society can mean a large organization, it is too vague to be correct in this context. Organizations can take on a variety of objectives, so it would not make sense if a daughter’s parents signed her up for “a large organization” in general.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because a sovereign nation means an independent country like the United States. One set of parents could not give their daughter a sovereign nation."
34,A,3,Historical Passages,Dual Passage,Words in Context,"Choice A is best. This word comes during the author’s description of how women have nothing to do, “so their whole energies are devoted to the massacre of old Time” (lines 27–28). The rest of this paragraph is an extended metaphor for how women murder “Time.” When the author says they “leave his carcass in ten-minute parcels at every friend’s house,” (lines 31–33), the author is really describing how women waste time by visiting their friends 10 minutes at a time. “Leaving” time is a metaphor, and “depositing” it is the closest answer here.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “depart” means “to leave from.” In the case of this passage, they are leaving time b​ehind​. Furthermore, it is not quite right to say “I depart time.""</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “permit” means “to allow” someone to do something. Given the extended metaphor in this paragraph, it is not right to say that the women are permitting time to do anything — they are just wasting it. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because to “run” Time’s carcass would not be an appropriate metaphor for wasting time. “Run,” in this sense, could mean to go in a particular direction, which is not what these women are doing to Time’s carcass."
35,D,4,Historical Passages,Dual Passage,Author-Based Questions,"Choice D is best. ​The author of passage 2 clearly contrasts men and women. Men, he says, have the “energy...for conquest” (lines 49–50), but women’s “great function is Praise” (line 56). Thus, in paragraph one, the author clearly implies that men are built for more bold endeavors while women should be more reserved.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because early in the passage, the author describes m​en​ as having the “energy for adventure,” not women. Furthermore, in lines 58–59, women are characterized as “protected from all danger and temptation” and intended to generally stay in the house.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because while one of the roles of women can be inferred to be child-raising, the author does not say this outright. Rather, he more generally argues that women are best at running the household, which includes more than just child-raising. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because in paragraph one, the author says about women, “Her intellect is not for invention or creation” (lines 53–54). If this is the case, then women are certainly not the driving force behind human creativity."
36,B,4,Historical Passages,Dual Passage,Author-Based Questions,"Choice B is best. I​n this first paragraph of passage 2, Ruskin makes it clear that a man’s place is outside of the home, engaging in adventures and conquest, while a woman’s place is running the household. Ruskin later argues that keeping the home a sanctuary from the difficulties of the outside world is a critical job, especially in lines 64–75 (“Within his...to be home”). So, when Mulock says women have nothing to do but waste time, Ruskin would likely counter by saying their job is extremely important.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because Ruskin never claims that women are useless without the instruction of their fathers or husbands. Rather, he says that men and women’s roles are clearly defined and work well in conjunction with each other. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because Ruskin does not mention religious devotion in this passage. When he does use words like sacred, sanctuary, and God, he does so in reference to the importance of the home. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because this would be Mulock’s argument, not Ruskin’s. Ruskin values the concept of home and the women who run it, and believes their job is of critical importance."
37,D,3,Historical Passages,Dual Passage,Supporting Evidence,"Choice D is best. As described in the answer to question 36, lines 65–72 (“Within...division”) are where the author makes it clear that women’s role of running the house in order to create a safe haven from the outside world is quite crucial. The house is “ruled by her” (line 66), and the house is “the place of Peace, the shelter...from all terror, doubt, and division” (lines 69–72).</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because these lines outline what women are not capable of: battle, invention, and creation. These lines do not defend Ruskin’s idea that women as organizers of the home hold an important role. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because this line just says that women’s function is praise; again, it does not relate to her role in running the house. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because these lines state that men’s role is to protect women from “all this,” meaning the dangers and temptations of the outside world. They do not specify women’s role. "
38,D,4,Historical Passages,Dual Passage,Author-Based Questions,"Choice D is best. ​At the end of passage 2, Ruskin makes it clear that women hold an important role in society: to run the household and to keep it a sanctuary from the dangers of the world. Mulock, however, claims women have nothing to do except fall in love and waste time; their parents and husbands take care of everything else. While Ruskin’s account of women does seem more exciting and impactful, Mulock would probably believe hers is more accurate, considering she is a woman writing about her own experiences.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because Mulock is clear that women’s lives during this time were painfully boring, and Ruskin says that women do not have the intellect for creativity. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because Mulock complains that the traditional roles of men and women — roles Ruskin is in favor of — leaves women with very little to do. She desires something very different from Ruskin. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because Ruskin clearly defines the roles men and women have in life. Although he is clear, Mulock rejects his perspective. "
39,C,3,Historical Passages,Dual Passage,Supporting Evidence,"Choice C is best. Mulock would probably reject Ruskin’s grand view of women’s running of the home as a sanctuary because it is not an accurate portrayal of what women actually do. In the third paragraph, with the long metaphor of wasting time, Mulock makes this perfectly clear. In lines 28–33 (“They prick...think of”) especially, she details how women are simply wasting time with mundane tasks.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because these lines articulate many fathers’ attitudes towards their daughters, but they do not relate to Ruskin’s views on running the house. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because these lines describe what fathers do for their daughters, but they do not yet articulate Mulock’s resentment to traditional gender roles. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because these lines just say that everyone receives the gift of time equally. There is no mention of gender roles or Mulock’s feelings towards them."
40,A,4,Historical Passages,Dual Passage,Author-Based Questions,"Choice A is best. It’s hard to think of these two passages as anything other than contradictory. Mulock states that women have nothing to live for because everything is taken care of for them, so they end up wasting time their entire lives. Ruskin, on the other hand, argues that women critically keep the home safe from the dangers and temptations of the world. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because Mulock and Ruskin offer different views of women’s lives during this time period. They do not agree on anything, much less combine in support of a common cause.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because while Mulock presents the problem of boredom in women’s lives, she (and many others) probably would not agree that Ruskin “solves” that problem. It is not as cut and dry as that. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because Ruskin does not directly refute what women are expected to do; rather, he argues that what they do is not boring, but critically important."
41,B,4,Historical Passages,Dual Passage,Author-Based Questions,"Choice B is best. I​n passage 2, Ruskin offers an idyllic vision of traditional gender roles: men brave the outside world, with all of its dangers and temptations, while women build the home into a sanctuary. In his mind, this “balance” is the social ideal. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because what Ruskin is arguing in favor of is not a social reform but rather an affirmation of traditional gender roles.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because Ruskin describes what happens in an ideal society but does not consider the negative consequences of these happenings.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because again, Ruskin is affirming a traditional societal norm, not describing a new social problem.

42,C,3,Historical Passages,Science Passages,,"Choice C is best. P​aragraph 1 gives a brief history of the Bermuda Triangle, spanning from the time of Christopher Columbus to the interests of modern science. The next two paragraphs then detail possible explanations for the mysterious events occurring in this region, starting with the different focuses of scientific research and then dipping into the paranormal. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because while this is part of one explanation for the mystery surrounding the Bermuda Triangle, it is not the main purpose of the passage. It is one explanation out of several. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because again, Steve Miller’s potential discovery is just one explanation of many theories mentioned in the passage. The main topic of the reading as a whole is still the mystery surrounding the Bermuda Triangle. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because for one, this passage focuses on the Bermuda Triangle, not weather patterns in general. Moreover, the author also presents non-scientific approaches to explaining what happens there."
43,B,3,Historical Passages,Science Passages,Author-Based Questions,"Choice B is best. This is simple fact recall. In lines 22–25 (“In particular...hopelessly lost”), the author says that compasses stray from magnetic North. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because normally functioning compasses point to the North Pole. The point here is that compasses do not work normally in the Bermuda Triangle. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because while it is true that compasses do not work normally in the Bermuda Triangle, the author never mentions anything about spinning endlessly. They just deviate from true North.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because again, there is no mention of the compasses breaking; they just point in the wrong direction."
44,A,2,Historical Passages,Science Passages,Supporting Evidence,"Choice A is best. A​s indicated above, in these lines, the author specifically states that “compasses have been reported to stray from magnetic North.”</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because lines 25–30 introduce two hypotheses for w​hy​ compasses stray from magnetic North. It does not answer the question of ​how​ compasses actually perform in the Bermuda Triangle. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because lines 42–45 introduce another national phenomenon that may explain why ships get lost. It does not answer the question of what compasses do in the Bermuda Triangle. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because lines 59–63 expand upon another hypothesis for why ships disappear that has not yet been tested. It does not answer the question of what compasses do in the Bermuda Triangle."
45,D,2,Historical Passages,Science Passages,Words in Context,"Choice D is best. “Self-proclaimed” means “to describe oneself.” In this context, Edward Case being a “self-proclaimed” psychic means that he has labeled himself a psychic, even if he has not earned that designation from others. In other words, Case has established his own reputation. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because in the context of this sentence, “self-proclaimed” is used to describe Edward Case specifically as a psychic; it is not being used to characterize psychic matters more generally. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because while this is implied in the passage and presents a compelling case for being correct, the highlighted words have to be read literally here. While “self-proclaimed” often implies a lack of legitimacy, it directly means “to be self-described."" </br>It’s NOT Choice C because while the author does ponder this question throughout the passage, it has nothing to do with Case proclaiming himself a psychic. Even more straightforward is the fact that “self-proclaimed” does not mean “unexplainable by science."""
46,A,2,Historical Passages,Science Passages,,"Choice A is best. T​he first paragraph in the passage introduces a brief history of the Bermuda Triangle, the second paragraph discusses scientific hypotheses for the mysterious events that occur there, and the third paragraph posits supernatural explanations for the Triangle’s happenings. Thus, after the introduction, the passage clearly shifts from a scientific discussion in paragraph two to supernatural speculation in paragraph three. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “engaging narrative” does not accurately describe the objective scientific discussion characterizing the first half of the passage, and “technical recap” does not perfectly explain the supernatural-based second half. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because this answer is in reverse order. The author explores the scientific experiments and hypotheses first, then looks toward the supernatural. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because while the “mud volcanoes” are a type of weather anomaly that may explain the occurrences in the Bermuda Triangle, they are only one of many hypotheses described in this passage."
47,D,3,Historical Passages,Science Passages,,"Choice D is best. Paragraph two discusses scientific explanations for the Bermuda Triangle and paragraph three introduces supernatural explanations. Lines 65–67 (“If traditional...paranormal”) establish the transition between the two, signaling the shift in focus from the science to the supernatural. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because these lines describe the disappearance of the USS Pickering and other mysterious incidents. These details are just part of the introduction and do not signal a shift in focus.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because these lines introduce one of the hypotheses for why ships lose control in the Triangle. This information comes in the middle of a discussion on the science-backed explanations and does not signal a shift in focus. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because, similar to Choice B, these lines just describe one of the scientific explanations for the mysterious incidents and do not signal a shift in focus."
48,C,3,Historical Passages,Science Passages,Words in Context,"Choice C is best. The author introduces this paragraph-long discussion on scientific explanations in lines 16–17 by saying “modern science has come a long way.” The idea that these scientific explanations are modern is critical to their legitimacy, so the author uses the phrase “as recently as 2016 on the ​Science Channel”​ to remind the reader that these investigations are ongoing. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because Steve Miller’s theory has not yet failed; he has simply proclaimed publicly another hypothesis for the region’s events. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because even though Steve Miller’s theory is promising, it does not decisively conclude inquiry into the Bermuda Triangle. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because while this may be inferred from the author’s defense of scientific methods, it does not fit with this phrase specifically. Saying that something is “recent” does not imply faith."
49,D,3,Historical Passages,Science Passages,,"Choice D is best. ​This question asks about air bombs as the cause for the incidents in the Bermuda Triangle; lines 54–59 literally say that air bombs unleash gusts of wind “capable of taking down large vessels, both naval and airborne.” In other words, the bombs can initiate weather that can take down large ships and planes, which comprises a large portion of the Triangle’s mysterious happenings.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because these lines introduce the idea that downdrafts of cold air could cause the events. Air bombs have not yet been introduced. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because again, air bombs have not yet been introduced into the discussion. Although these lines say that a new weather pattern could help our understanding of the Triangle, the author has not named air bombs yet.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because these lines describe what air bombs are but do not explain how they could work in the Bermuda Triangle."
50,C,4,Historical Passages,Science Passages,Data Analysis,"Choice C is best. ""Methane hydrates” are first referenced in lines 40–41, and in lines 43–45 (“Essentially...swallowed up”), the author explains that methane gas can decrease the density of ocean water, causing ships to sink. So, on the graph, look for the time of year when water density is the lowest.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because water density was rising in the fall of that year.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because water density was highest during the winter. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because the equinoxes take place in late March and September, when water density was still fairly high."
51,C,2,Historical Passages,Science Passages,Data Analysis,"Choice C is best. I​n lines 43–45 (“Essentially...swallowed up”), the author explains that methane gas can decrease the density of ocean water, causing ships to sink. So, that implies that it is safest to sail when water density is highest, which is in late winter according to the graph. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the water density in the spring drops off from the high in late winter.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because water density in the fall is lower than it is in the winter. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because the equinoxes are in the spring and fall, and water density is lower in the spring and fall than in the winter."
52,A,2,Historical Passages,Science Passages,Data Analysis,"Choice A is best. This graph shows that water density follows a clear seasonal progression. It hits its highest point in late winter, then drops in the spring before hitting its lowest point in the summer, then rises again in the fall. Water density in the Bermuda Triangle is lowest in the summer. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because the graph does not show methane hydrates. Even though the passage suggests they can affect water density in specific moments, they do not affect the yearly progression of water density. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because this graph does not measure methane hydrate occurrence, but rather water density. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because as explained in lines 40–42 (“The discovery...been lost”), the idea that changes in water density can sink ships is an unproven hypothesis, and one of many hypotheses that could explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle."
