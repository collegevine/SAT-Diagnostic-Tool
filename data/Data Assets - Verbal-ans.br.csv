Paragraph two holds the key to answering this question, as it describes what happens to men and women in this time after they finish their education. Men “leave school and plunge into life” (lines 7-8) while women “finish their education, come home, and stay at home. That is enough.” (lines 8-10). The rest of this paragraph then goes on to describe life for many women, which includes “they have an abundance of time and nothing to occupy it; plenty of money, and little use for it; pleasure without end, but not one definite object of interest…” (lines 16-20).

When the author says they “leave his carcass in ten-minute parcels at every friend’s house they can think of,” (lines 31-33) that means women waste time by visiting their friends 10 minutes at a time. “Leaving” time is a metaphor, and depositing it is the closest answer here.

In this first paragraph of passage two, Ruskin makes it clear that men’s place is outside of the home, engaging in adventures and conquest while women’s place is running the household. Then, throughout paragraph two, Ruskin argues that running the home well and keeping it a sanctuary from the difficulties of the outside world is a critical job, especially in lines 65-77 (“Within his...to be home.”) So, when Mulock says women have nothing to do but waste time, Ruskin would counter by saying their job is extremely important.         </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because Ruskin never claims that women are useless without the instruction of their fathers or husbands.

At the end of passage 2, Ruskin makes it clear that women hold an important role in society, and that is to run the household and to keep it a sanctuary from the dangers of the outside world. Mulock, however, claims women have nothing to do except fall in love and waste time. Their parents and husbands take care of everything else, from working to domestic chores. While Ruskin’s account of women does seem more exciting and impactful, Mulock would probably believe hers is more accurate, considering she is a woman writing about her own experiences. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because Mulock is clear that women’s lives during this time were painfully boring, and Ruskin says that women do not have the intellect for creativity. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because Mulock complains that the traditional roles of men and women, that Ruskin argues in favor of, leaves women will very little to do.

It is not as cut and dry as that. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because Ruskin does not directly refute what women are expected to do; rather, he argues that what they do is not boring but critically important."
41,"B",4,"Historical","Dual Passage","Author-Based Questions","Choice B is best. In passage 2, Ruskin offers an idyllic vision of traditional gender roles: men brave the outside world, in all its dangers and temptations, while women build the home into a sanctuary from it. In his mind, this is the social ideal. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because what Ruskin is arguing in favor of is not a social reform, but rather an affirmation of traditional gender roles. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because Ruskin describes what happens in an ideal society, but does not look at the negative consequences of it. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because again, Ruskin is affirming a traditional societal norm, not describing a new social problem. "
42,"C",3,"Historical","Science Passages","","Choice C is best. Paragraph 1 gives a brief history of the Bermuda Triangle, stretching from Christopher Columbus to modern science. The next 2 paragraphs then detail possible explanations for the problems there, starting with various scientific research then dipping into the paranormal. This passage introduces the history and current theories of the Bermuda Triangle. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because while this is part of one explanation for the mystery surrounding the Bermuda Triangle, it is not the main purpose of the passage. It is just one explanation out of several. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because again Steve Miller’s potential discovery is just also just one explanation out of several. The main topic is still the mystery surrounding the Bermuda Triangle. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because for one, this passage focuses on the Bermuda Triangle, not weather patterns in general. Moreover, the author also uses non-scientific methods to explain what happens there."
43,"B",3,"Historical","Science Passages","Author-Based Questions","Choice B is best. This is simple fact recall, because in lines 22-25 (“The Bermuda...hopelessly lost”), the author says that compasses stray from magnetic North. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because normally functioning compasses point to the North Pole. The point is that in the Bermuda Triangle, compasses do not work normally. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because while it is true that compasses do not work normally in the Bermuda Triangle, the author never says anything about spinning endlessly. They just deviate or stray from true North.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because while again they are not working normally, the compasses don’t “break”; they just point in a wrong direction."
44,"A",2,"Historical","Science Passages","Supporting Evidence","Choice A is best. As indicated above, in these lines the author specifically states “compasses have been reported to stray from magnetic North.”</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because lines 25-30 introduce two hypotheses for why compasses stray from the magnetic North. It does not answer the question of what compasses do in the Bermuda Triangle. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because lines 43-46 introduce another hypothesis to explain why ships get lost. It does not answer the question of what compasses do in the Bermuda Triangle. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because lines 60-64 explain another hypothesis for why ships disappear  that has not been tested yet. It does not answer the question of what compasses do in the Bermuda Triangle."
45,"D",2,"Historical","Science Passages","Words in Context","Choice D is best. “Self-proclaimed” means be described by yourself, not by others. In this case, saying that Edward Case is a “self-proclaimed” means that he labels himself as a psychic, even if others do not. Therefore, he established his own reputation. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because in the context of this sentence, self-proclaimed is used to describe Edward Case as a psychic. The passage does not say that psychic matters should be judged by people individually, especially in this sentence. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because while this is implied in the passage and presents a compelling case for being correct, the highlighted words have to be read literally here. While “self-proclaimed” often implies that no one else would describe it as real, it really means to describe it yourself. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because while the author does ponder this question, it has nothing to do with Case proclaiming himself a psychic. “Self Proclaimed” does not mean science cannot explain something"
46,"A",2,"Historical","Science Passages","","Choice A is best. The first paragraph in the passage introduces a brief history of the Bermuda Triangle, the second paragraph introduces scientific hypotheses for why mysterious things happen there, and the third paragraph introduces supernatural hypotheses. After the introduction, the passage shifts from a scientific discussion on the Bermuda Triangle in paragraph two to a supernatural speculation in paragraph three. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because it is unclear where the “engaging narrative” is in the passage, but a “strict technical recap” does not perfectly explain the second part of the passage. While there are some technical aspects, the author also dives into non-technical explanations. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because this answer is in reverse order. The author explores the scientific experiments and hypotheses first, then looks toward the supernatural. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because the “mud volcanoes” is a type of weather anomaly that may explain the occurrences in the Bermuda triangle; they are one focus. Moreover, these explanations take up a small part of the passage."
47,"D",3,"Historical","Science Passages","","Choice D is best. As described above, paragraph two discusses scientific explanations for the Bermuda Triangle and paragraph three introduces supernatural explanations. Lines 65-67 (“If traditional...paranormal”) provides the transition between the two, and signals a shift in focus from the science-backed to the supernatural. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because these lines describe the disappearance of the USS Pickering and other mysterious incidents. It is just part of the introduction into the triangle, and does not signal a shift in focus.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because these lines introduce one of the hypotheses for why ships lose control there. It comes in the middle of a discussion on the science-backed explanations, and does not signal a shift in focus. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because, similar to the lines from Choice B, these lines just describe one of the scientific explanations for mysterious incidents, and does not signal a shift in focus."
48,"C",3,"Historical","Science Passages","Words in Context","Choice C is best. The author introduces this discussion on scientific explanations for the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle in lines 16-17, saying “modern science has come a long way.” The idea that these scientific explanations are modern is critical to their legitimacy, so the author uses the phrase “as recently as 2016 on the Science Passages Channel” to remind the reader that these investigations are ongoing. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because Steve Miller’s theory has not failed yet, and the author would not use that phrase specifically to say that it had. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because even though Steve Miller’s theory is promising, it does not end the inquiry into the Bermuda Triangle. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because while this may be inferred from the author’s defense of scientific methods, it does not fit with this phrase specifically. Saying that something is recent does not imply faith in it."
49,"D",3,"Historical","Science Passages","","Choice D is best. This questions asks for which lines suggest that air bombs could cause the incidents in the Bermuda Triangle, and lines 55-59 literally say that air bombs can take down large ships and planes, which is a large part of the mysterious happenings there. </br></br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because these lines introduce the idea that downdrafts of cold air could cause them. Air bombs have not been introduced yet. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because again, air bombs have not been introduced yet. Although these lines say that a new weather pattern could help our understanding of the Triangle, the author has not named air bombs yet.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because these lines describe what air bombs are (still without naming them yet), but does not explain how they could work in the Bermuda Triangle."
50,"C",4,"Historical","Science Passages","Data Analysis","Choice C is best. In lines 43-46 (“Essentially...swallowed up.”), the author explains that methane gas can decrease the density of ocean water, causing ships to sink. So, on the graph, look for the time of year when water density is the lowest.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because water density was rising in the fall of that year.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because water density was highest during the winter. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because the equinoxes take place in late March and September, when water density was still fairly high."
51,"C",2,"Historical","Science Passages","Data Analysis","Choice C is best. In lines 43-46 (“Essentially...swallowed up.”), the author explains that methane gas can decrease the density of ocean water, causing ships to sink. So, that implies that it is safest to sail when water density is highest, which according to the graph is in late winter. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the water density in the spring drops off from the high in late winter.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because water density in the fall is lower than it is in winter. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because the equinoxes are in the spring and fall, and water density is lower in spring and fall."
52,"A",2,"Historical","Science Passages","Data Analysis","Choice A is best. This graph shows that water density follows a clear seasonal progression. It hits its highest point in late winter, then drops in the spring before hitting its lowest point in the summer, then rises again in the fall. Water density in the Bermuda Triangle is lowest in the summer. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because the graph does not show methane hydrates. Even though the passage suggests they can affect water density in moments, they do not affect the yearly progression of water density. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because there again, this graph does not measure methane hydrate occurrence, but rather water density. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because as explained in the passage, lines 40-43 (“The discovery...been lost”), the idea that water density changes can sink ships is an unproven hypothesis, and one of many that could explain the mystery surrounding the Bermuda Triangle."
