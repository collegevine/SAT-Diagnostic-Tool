<b>Choice B is correct.</b>
Because lines \(d\) and \(e\) are parallel, the two triangles created by these lines intersecting angle \(a°\) contain equivalent angles.
Since the sum of all angles in a triangle is equal to 180°, we know that \(a+b+c=180\).
Given the values for \(b°\) and \(c°\), we can solve for \(a°\): \(a+30+40=180\). Therefore, \(a=180-70=110\).
