<b>Choice B is correct.</b>
First, we need to untangle exactly what this problem is presenting.
The graph is of \(g(x)\), and the table shows \(f(x)\) values for given values of \(x\). The problem then defines the minimum of \(g\) to be \(a\). In other words, the minimum \(y\) value for the function \(g(x)\) is \(a\). We can see the lowest \(y\) value on the graph of \(g(x)\) is \(-4\), so \(a=-4\).
</br></br>
From there, plug \(a=-4\) into \(f(x)\) to determine \(f(-4)\). Use the table to find that \(f(-4)=-1\).
