<b>0.6 is correct.</b> 
We can determine the value of \(p\) by plugging in one of the coordinate pairs from the chart into our equation.
</br></br>
For example, plug the pair \((4,54)\) into the function \(S\): $$ 54=150p^{4/2} $$
Divide both sides by 150: $$ p^{4/2}=\frac{54}{150}=0.36 $$
Take the square root to solve: $$ \sqrt{p^2}=\sqrt{0.36}=0.6 $$
