<b>Choice D is correct.</b>
First, calculate the ranges of each data set by subtracting the minimum from the maximum: $$ \text{Before modification}=196-164=32 $$
$$ \text{After modification}=204-172=32 $$
The range for both sets is 32, therefore \(r_1=r_2\). This limits our possible answers to A and D. From the distribution of dots (normal distribution vs. flat distribution), it is evident that the variance is not equal for these two data sets, so \(v_1 \neg v_2\).
