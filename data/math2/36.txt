<b>0 is correct.</b> 
The side lengths are not relevant in this problem; what is necessary to know is that \(∠ABC=90°\), and that it is split by line segment \(\overline{BE}\). One possible way that this would look is illustrated below, but \(E\) could be anywhere along line segment \(\overline{AC}\):

It is clear that \(∠CBE\) is equal to \(90-∠ABE\), so rewrite: $$ sin(∠ABE)-cos(∠CBE) \implies sin(∠ABE)-cos(90-∠ABE) $$
Recall the trig identity \(sin(x)=cos(90-x)\) and rewrite: $$ cos(90-∠ABE) \implies sin(∠ABE) $$
Simplify: $$ sin(∠ABE)-sin(∠ABE)=0 $$
