<b>Choice A is correct.</b>
Recall that the mode is the number that appears the most, the median is the middle number in an ordered set, and the mean is the average across a set.
</br>
</br>
Determine the <b>mode</b>: The mode is 25 because it has the highest frequency (9).
</br>
</br>
Find the <b>median</b>: There are 30 parents in the birthing class, so the median will be the average of the 15th and 16th numbers (remember that the median of an even number is the average of the two middle numbers). The 15th and 16th parents are both 26 years old, so the median is 26. 
</br>
</br>
Calculate the <b>mean</b>: Add together the weighted total of all ages and divide by 30: $$ \frac{(25 \times 9)+(26 \times 8)+(27 \times 5)+(29 \times 2)+(30 \times 2)+(42 \times 1)}{30} = 27.07 $$
</br>
</br>
Since we know that the mode is 25, the median is 26, and the mean is 27, the answer is \(\text{mode} \lt \text{median} \lt \text{mean}\).
