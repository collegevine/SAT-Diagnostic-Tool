<b>Choice B is correct.</b> 
We know that \(b\) is a constant, so for this problem, we can generate a system of equations and solve for \(b\).
</br></br>
We are given the first equation: $$ y=x+b $$
For the second equation, plug in the coordinate pair \((7y,3x)\) given: $$ 7y=3(3x)+b $$ 
$$7y=9x+b$$
Rearrange both equations: $$ y=x+b \implies y-x=b $$
$$ 7y=9x+b \implies 7y-9x=b $$
Now that both equations are set equal to \(b\), we can set them equal to each other: $$ 7y-9x=y-x $$
Isolate the variables to each side: $$ 6y=8x $$
Rearrange to get the variables into \(\frac{y}{x}\) form: $$ \frac{6y}{x}=8 $$
$$ \frac{y}{x}=\frac{8}{6}=\frac{4}{3} $$
</br></br>
<i>Note: This question is testing ability to think outside of normal circumstances. If using the variables \(x\) and \(y\)  in the equation is confusing, you can replace those with other variables for your calculations. (Plugging in \(c\) and \(d\) into \(y=x+b\), for example).
