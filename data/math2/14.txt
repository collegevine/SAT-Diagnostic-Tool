<b>Choice D is correct.</b>
A fraction is undefined when its denominator equals zero. Therefore, this question is asking for us to find \(y\) where \(y^2+2y-15=0\). 
</br>
</br>
Factor the polynomial to find the equivalent expression \((y+5)(y-3)=0\). From the roots of this equation, we know that the denominator equals zero when \(y=-5\) and when \(y=3\).
</br>
</br>
Looking through our possible answers, of \(-5\) and \(3\), only \(3\) is given.
