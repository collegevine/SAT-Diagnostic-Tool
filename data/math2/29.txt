<b>Choice B is correct.</b> 
The key thing to understand here is that rate of consumption is constant, i.e. linear. We would not use a variable rate equation for gasoline consumption because the lawnmower will use the same amount of gasoline per minute regardless of how much gasoline is in the tank.
</br></br> 
To determine how much gasoline is used per minute, take the amount of gasoline lost so far (20% of 10 gallons) and divide that by 40 minutes: $$ \frac{0.20 \times 10}{40}=0.05 $$
Take the initial gasoline volume and subtract \(0.05m\) to determine how much remains in the tank: $$ g=10-0.05m $$
