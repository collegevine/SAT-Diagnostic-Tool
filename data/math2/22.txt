<b>Choice A is correct.</b> 
First, determine the amount of wheat produced in each of these years according to the line of best fit. 2013 represents an x-value of 16, and 2017 represents an x-value of 21. Plug 16 and 21 into the best fit equation: $$ 2017 /implies 1.93 \times 21+22.45=62.98 $$
$$ 2013 \implies 1.93 \times 16+22.45=53.33 $$
</br>
Recall the percent increase equation and substitute in known values: $$ \text{% increase} = \frac{(\text{initial-final})}{\text{initial}} \times 100 $$
$$ \text{% increase} = \frac{62.98-53.33}{53.33} = 0.181 \times 100 = 18.1% $$
</br>
Of the possible answers, this is closest to 15%.
