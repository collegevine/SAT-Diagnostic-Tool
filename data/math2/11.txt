<b>Choice B is correct.</b>
We are given the information that the gas tank can hold approximately 12 fluid ounces, and that Katie’s can contains 6 quarts of gas. We are also given that 6 quarts = 192 fluid ounces. Thus, simply divide 192 (the amount of gas in Katie’s can) by 12 (the maximum capacity of the tank) to solve: \(192 \div 12=16\).s
