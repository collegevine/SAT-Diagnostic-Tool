<b>696 is correct.</b>
For this question, use the data available in the chart.
</br></br>
At 4 minutes, there are 54 grams of salt per liter of water. Multiply this concentration by 15 liters: \(54 \times 15=810\) grams of salt in 15 liters of water at 4 minutes.
</br></br>
We also know from the chart that there are 19 grams of salt per liter at 8 minutes. Multiply this concentration by 6 liters: \(19 \times 6=114\) grams of salt in 6 liters of water at 8 minutes.
</br></br>
Now we take the difference to get our answer: \(810g-114g=696g\).
