<b>Choice B is correct.</b>
The key to chart questions is to focus only on the data relevant to the question. Here, they want to know the proportion of seniors <i>who took vitamins</i> that <i>reported pain</i>. Select only the relevant information.
 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th></b>Pain</b></th>
    <th>No pain</th>
    <th><b>Total</b></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Painkiller</td>
    <td>52</td>
    <td>148</td>
    <td>200</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Vitamin</b> </td>
    <td><b>28</b></td>
    <td>172</td>
    <td><b>200</b></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Total</td>
    <td>80</td>
    <td>320</td>
    <td>400</td>
  </tr>

</table>
To find the proportion, take the number of seniors on vitamins who felt pain and divide it by the total number of seniors on vitamins, which is \(\frac{28}{200}=\frac{7}{50}\).
