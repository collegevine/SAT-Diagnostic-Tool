<b>Choice C is correct.</b>
We know that 1.93 is the slope of the line of best fit.
Since slope is equivalent to rise over run \((m=\frac{rise}{run})\), we can describe slope as the average increase in the amount of wheat (in millions of tons) per year \((m=\frac{\text{Amount of wheat}}{\text{Number of years}})\).

<i>Note: D is a common incorrect answer to this question, but D would actually be the average \(y\) value across this line segment. The important thing is to focus on slope representing an increase/decrease from year to year.
