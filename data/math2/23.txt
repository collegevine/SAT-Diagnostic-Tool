<b>Choice B is correct.</b>
We know that \(y\) is equal to the number of years and \(f\) is equal to the number of half years. 
</br></br>
There are two half years for every year; given any number of half years, you would need to divide \(f\) by 2 to get to \(y\): $$ y=\frac{f}{2} $$
Substitute this new \(y\) into the original rate equation: $$ R=1500(1.03)^y $$
$$ R=1500(1.03)^\frac{f}{2} $$
