<b>Choice A is correct.</b> 
You know the zeroes (x-intercepts) are -2 and 3, which eliminates B as an option immediately. The question also presents the information that the range (i.e. the y-values) maxes out at 5, so consider which graph is never greater than 5. Both graphs C and D have portions of their curve that extend beyond 5, so the answer is A.
