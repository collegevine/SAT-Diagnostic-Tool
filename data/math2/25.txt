<b>Choice A is correct.</b> 
This question is asking you to calculate the slope from the data set and then come up with an equation in slope-intercept form that models the change in class size over the years.
</br>
</br>
First, calculate the slope: $$ \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{727-753}{2016-2006}=\frac{-26}{10}=-2.6 $$
Determine the y-intercept. 2006 is considered year 0, so the y-intercept is the size of the class in 2006: $$ b=753 $$
Combine these terms to produce a slope-intercept equation modeling the senior class size: $$ S(y)= 753-2.6y $$
</br>
</br>
<i> Note: “y” in the final equation just stands for year; it is actually the independent variable (x-axis variable).
This is different from the y-value in \(\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\), which was referring to the two dependent variables.</i>
