<b>Choice C is correct.</b> 
Using exponent rules, we know that a negative exponent gives the inverse and a fractional exponent gives the root of the base term. Therefore, we can rewrite \(c^{\frac{-1}{3}}\) as \(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{c}}\).

</br>
Rearrange and solve for \(c\): $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{c}}=y $$
$$ \frac{1}{y}=\sqrt[3]{c} $$
Cube both sides to isolate \(c\): $$ \frac{1}{y^3}=c $$
