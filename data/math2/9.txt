<b>Choice D is correct.</b>
This question looks more scary than it is.
Since you are given the maximum volume the tank can hold, simply plug that value into the given volume equation and solve for \(p\).

Begin with the volume equation and isolate \(p\): $$ 355=\frac{5 \pi p^3}{27} $$
$$ \frac{355 \times 27}{5} = p^3 $$
From there, take the cube root to solve: $$ \sqrt[3]{\frac{355 \times 27}{5 \pi}}=p=8.48 $$
