<b>Choice C is correct.</b>
We know that Carlosâ€™s goal was to have his total cars sold \((x+y)\) be greater than or equal to 62, and that he failed to reach that goal. Therefore, \(x+y\) must be less than 62, which can be written mathematically as: \(x+y \lt 62\). This limits our possible answers to A and C.

We are also given that the total value of the cars sold was greater than $4,000,000.
In other words, the combined value of \(x\) cars sold for $65,000 and \(y\) cars sold for $130,000 must be greater than $4,000,000. This is written mathematically as: \(65,000x+130,000y \gt 4,000,000\).
