<b>Choice B is correct.</b>
Because the problem is asking about the value of \(x+2\) instead of the value of \(x\), simplify the appearance of this equation:
</br>
</br>
Set \(x+2\) equal to \(y\): $$ x+2=\frac{3}{x+2} $$
$$ y=\frac{3}{y} $$
Cross-multiply and simplify: $$ y^2=3 $$
$$ y=\sqrt{3} $$
</br>
Since we originally defined \(y=x+2\), then \(x+2\) must also be equal to \(\sqrt{3}\).
