<b>Choice D is correct.</b> First, letâ€™s extract the relevant information from this word problem:
<ul>
 <li> passes in leather seats are $85 each </li>
 <li> passes for plastic seats are $50 each</li>
 <li> 475 total passes were sold </li>
 <li> $23,500 has been raised through pass sales </li>
</ul>
Now translate this information into equation form. \(S\) and \(P\) together must equal the total number of passes sold: \(S+P=475\)
</br>
</br>
And the combined revenue from these passes must equal $23,500. Multiplying \(S\) and \(P\) by their respective costs: \(85S+50P=$23,500\).
