1,D,1,Adverb Usage,,"Choice D is best. The prepositional phrase “For example” logically transitions from the topic sentence describing broad shifts to eco-friendly cars to the specific example of switching from an SUV to a Corolla.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “Regardless” means “in spite of something.""</br>It’s NOT Choice B because “In Contrast” indicates a contrast.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “However” indicates a contrast."
2,B,3,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms",,"Choice B is best. “​Eliminating” best describes the process of removing the need for lower speed limits.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “decimates” is too dramatic for the more straightforward tone of this passage; it implies a literal, total destruction.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “unseating” suggests removing a person or object that is in power.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “closing the book on” indicates a conclusion or resolution."
3,C,4,Parallel Structure,,"Choice C is best. T​he phrase “maximize savings” parallels the other two phrases within the sentence: both “offer more comfort” and “help reduce wear and tear” follow the structure of a present tense verb followed by a direct object.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “they maximize savings” has the extra subject, “they,” that violates the parallelism in the list.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because “savings maximizes” has no corresponding subject and is not parallel to the other phrases in the list.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “also it maximizes savings” does not parallel the other phrases in the list. Furthermore, “it” is singular whereas the subject it is referencing, “wagons,” is plural."
4,B,3,Clauses and Independence,,"Choice B is best. The option “volumes (which” is the only phrase that contains and properly utilizes the opening parenthesis for the “like the US)” phrase.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “volumes, which” does not contain an open parenthesis, leaving the sentence with just a single closing parenthesis.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “volumes which” does not contain an open parenthesis, leaving the sentence with just a single closing parenthesis.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “volumes; (which” contains a semicolon that is only used to separate independent clauses. A semicolon is not needed to integrate a parenthetical into a sentence."
5,D,2,Writing Quality Enhancement,,"Choice D is best. The phrase “2 million midsize vehicles” accurately reflects the graph and demonstrates the small number of vehicles that the author is claiming were “just” bought by American consumers from 2013–2017. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because while “6 million small SUVs” accurately reflects the graph, it is a large number of vehicles compared to the 2 million midsize vehicles and would not properly correlate with the author’s use of “just” preceding the phrase.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the same sentence later discusses the “8 million small sedans,” making this choice repetitive.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the paragraph later discusses “three times as many impractical, inefficient sports cars,” making this choice repetitive."
6,A,3,Writing Quality Enhancement,,"Choice A is best. The graph demonstrates how around 13 million pickup trucks were sold, making it the most-sold car within the data. Therefore, “more pickup trucks” logically completes the sentence describing the car more “purchased than any other vehicle type.”</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because the “large sedans” do not represent an extreme of the data; the graph shows how fewer sports cars and midsize vehicles were sold compared to large sedans.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the correct answer in question 5 already references midsize vehicles. So while fewer midsize vehicles were, in fact, sold according to the graph, including that detail here would be unnecessarily repetitive.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the graph demonstrates how fewer midsize vehicles were sold compared to sports cars."
7,B,3,Homophones,,"Choice B is best. “​Worse than” implies a comparison and does not contain the unnecessary comma separation (a comma would only be necessary if the connecting “than” statement was eliminated).</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “then” refers to a progression of time, and the usage of the comma is incorrect; if used, it would have to be followed by the subject “the low sales” as opposed to “then the low sales.”</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “then” refers to a progression of time.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the comma is incorrect; if used, it would have to be followed by the subject “the low sales” as opposed to “than the low sales."""
8,C,1,Verb Tenses,,"Choice C is best. ""Enlarge” is in the present tense and is the correct tense for the plural subject “small and large SUVs.""</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “enlarges” would be the singular present tense and we are talking about many SUVs.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because “are enlarging” is in the present progressive tense, and “enlarge” should be in the present tense to maintain parallel structure with the “has...impact” phrase.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “have enlarged” is in the present perfect progressive tense and we want to maintain parallel structure with the “has...impact"" phrase."
9,A,3,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms",,"Choice A is best. “​Formidable” has the connotation of challenge, which best characterizes the effects of carbon emission.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “rugged” is used more in a geological context to describe physical characteristics.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “sinister” suggests that something has villainous intentions.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “ominous” refers to something that is a warning."
10,C,4,Writing Quality Enhancement,,Choice C is best. “​Armed with these facts” best introduces the legislation that Lithuania and Estonia took in light of the scientific research presented in the passage.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the information presented would not be a sufficient rationale for the countries’ decisions. This answer is also very wordy.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the phrase suggests a lack of clarity and would not be ideal in an academic passage.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “this limitation” denotes a single limitation whereas the passage has discussed multiple limitations of SUVs.
11,A,3,Clauses and Independence,,"Choice A is best. “O​r” describes the difference between the two decisions that readers can take and is the logical follow-up to “either” mentioned earlier in the sentence.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “and” would erroneously suggest that readers do both actions, which would be illogical.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “nor” would mean that readers should not trade in their vehicles for more eco-friendly cars.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “but” suggests contrast."
12,A,4,Writing Quality Enhancement,,"Choice A is best. “​Orange, blue, and green,” correctly lists the three colors and separates the list from the explanation “the traditional colors...” that follows.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because repeating “orange, blue, and green” in back-to-back independent clauses is repetitive.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because repeating “orange, blue, and green” in back-to-back independent clauses is repetitive.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because semicolons are used to separate independent clauses and “the colors” cannot stand alone because it is lacking a verb."
13,D,3,Phrases,Clauses and Independence,"Choice D is best. The phrase “covered with massive painted murals” correctly links the dual adjectives “massive” and “painted” with their object, “murals.”</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the comma usage in “covered with massive, painted, murals” unnecessarily divides the dual adjectives and more nearly suggests a list.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the comma usage between “covered” and “with” is grammatically incorrect and makes it unclear what exactly is covering the buildings.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the em-dash between “murals” and “and posters” is grammatically incorrect because “— and posters” would not be further defining or emphasizing the murals."
14,C,5,Phrases,Unclear Sentences,"Choice C is best. This answer is an independent clause and can thus properly follow the preceding semicolon. Furthermore, this clause expands upon the “strength of the army” that concludes the previous independent clause, which exemplifies effective use of a semicolon sentence structure.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because a statement describing the pyramid as colorful is irrelevant to explaining its potential military application.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because describing what the pyramid was potentially called does not contribute to explaining why the military attempted it.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because this contradicts the topic sentence of the paragraph."
15,C,3,Writing Quality Enhancement,,"Choice C is best. This sentence best concludes the paragraph because it addresses the uncertainty regarding the pyramid’s origins and transitions into its modern manifestation.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the sentence does not conclude the paragraph; it only repeats previously implied information.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because this sentence understates the pyramids’ historical and present popularity and it contradicts information presented in the first paragraph of the passage.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because this sentence suggests that more information will follow regarding the pyramids’ present value, which would work better as a topic sentence, not a concluding sentence. Furthermore, this statement also fails to encapsulate the main idea of the paragraph."
16,A,2,Pronouns and Noun Substitutes,,"Choice A is best. Recall the correct usage of “whom.” In this sentence, the underlined phrase is a modifier describing the two objects of the sentence — the two men — so “both of whom” is correct.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “both” by itself in the context of this sentence would be the subject of an independent clause and thus it cannot be used alone within a modifying clause with a comma. If the comma after “pyramid” was switched to a period, semicolon, or em-dash, only then could “both” be correct.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “of which both” suggests objects, not individuals. Furthermore, “of which” is generally used to indicate a portion of a given object; in this case, the entirety of the sentence’s object (both men) is being described.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “both of them” is a grammatical subject for an independent clause, not a modifying clause."
17,D,4,Unclear Sentences,False Comparisons,"Choice D is best. This question tests your ability to recognize false comparisons. Because the sentence begins with the subject “Many of the skills required,” the comparison must be made to “those [the skills] in acrobatics and cheerleading.”</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “acrobatics and cheerleading” are sports, which cannot in and of themselves be directly compared to the “skills required.”</br>It’s NOT Choice B because “disciplines” most literally means “subject areas.” Again, “disciplines” and “skills required” cannot be directly compared because they are two different classes of objects.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “acrobats and cheerleaders” signify people. People and “skills required” cannot be compared because they are two different classes of objects."
18,B,2,Writing Quality Enhancement,,"Choice B is best. T​he topic sentence introduces this paragraph’s theme of symbolism in the pot. The phrase “to represent Krishna’s humble origins” best draws a connection between the physical appearance of the clay pot and the more abstract, grander meaning behind that simplicity. Furthermore, there is a direct connection between the descriptors “simple” and “humble.”</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “a clay pot” describes the physical appearance of the pot and does not introduce any symbolic meaning.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “from Indian Mythology” does not add any information relating to the underlying symbolism of the pot’s simplicity.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “for symbolic reasons” is vague and too explicit. This information is also redundant of the overarching purpose of the paragraph."
19,A,4,Writing Quality Enhancement,,"Choice A is ​best​. S​entence 5 parallels the structure and content of sentences 3 and 4 in that all three sentences mention a dairy product and then define its symbolic nature. Because of this parallelism, sentence 5 naturally follows 3 and 4.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because it would then be separated from the parallelism established by sentences 3 and 4. Furthermore, it would not make sense to place sentence 5 before sentence 2, which expands upon the introduction of symbolism in this paragraph.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because while this is a tempting option because it would not interrupt the parallelism of sentences 3–5, it would interrupt the growing complexity of this parallel structure. Note that cow’s milk is a common household staple, goat’s and buffalo’s milk are more rare, and cottage cheese and yogurt are physically more complicated than milk. In short, beyond the parallelism, there is an increasing level of complexity to the dairy products mentioned that ought to be maintained.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because this would remove sentence 5 from the parallelism of sentences 3 and 4 and contest the conclusive tone of sentence 7."
20,B,3,Apostrophes and Contractions,Pronouns and Noun Substitutes,"Choice B is b​est​. R​ecall that the form “its” without an apostrophe is used to indicate possession. In this sentence, we are talking about the culmination of the game—the game’s culmination—which requires a possessive pronoun.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “it’s” with an apostrophe is a contraction of “it is,” which does not indicate the necessary possession.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “there” refers to a location.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “their” is plural while the subject it is referring to, “game,” is singular. Furthermore, “their” is most appropriately used when referring to a person, and the subject, “game” is a non-living object."
21,B,4,Objects vs. Subjects,,"Choice B is b​est​. T​his sentence is grammatically correct and the most concise, and it makes the player the subject of the sentence for active voice.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the “fist” is the subject of this sentence even though the player is the agent of the action.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the player is initiating the action and ought to be the subject of the sentence, not the “pot of milk.” Furthermore, this option represents a poor use of passive voice—in which a subject receives an action—which is generally considered to represent lower quality writing.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “fist of the player” is not concise, and again, the player is performing the action and ought to be the subject of the sentence."
22,D,4,Writing Quality Enhancement,,"Choice D is b​est​. ​Using “milk” is concise and grammatically correct, and by itself can fully encapsulate what happens at this moment in the tradition.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the “milk in the pot” is redundant; it is well-known that the pot contains milk at this point in the passage. Furthermore, “instead of drinking it” introduces unnecessary details to this description.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the information about how long the milk had been sitting out is extraneous information with regard to the description of the action.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because it is well-established that the milk was in the pot. It is redundant to repeat this description, and the phrasing “pot that had milk in it” is unnecessarily wordy."
23,A,4,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms",,"Choice A is best. We want to identify the word that conveys the degree of precision these accountants dedicate to their work. “Meticulous” is the most appropriate choice that accomplishes this meaning while maintaining the didactic tone of the paragraph.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “super-precise” is a bit informal, and it lacks the instructive tone of the passage.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “on-the-dot” is needlessly wordy.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “fierce” generally conveys a sense of intensity and power, which is not a proper characterization of the “notes” being described."
24,C,4,Parallel Structure,,"Choice C is best. I​n this sentence, we learn that accountants keep three different records: notes, expenses, and transactions. With three items being listed, we merely need a comma to separate “payments” from “expenses,” and an Oxford comma to separate “expenses” from “and other...”</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because a semicolon can only be used to separate two independent clauses. The phrase after the semicolon is not an independent clause.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because a semicolon can only be used to separate two independent clauses. “Expenses” is not an independent clause.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because items in a list require commas for separation."
25,C,3,Writing Quality Enhancement,,"Choice C is best. As is immediately evident from the title of the graph, the data included introduces information about the salaries of accountants compared to those of other occupations. The overall purpose of this passage and this paragraph in particular is to compare human and software accountants. Hence, this graph presents information that is not relevant to the focus of the passage.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because salary information does not directly equate to importance. Additionally, the data shows that accountants make less than the median for financial occupations as a whole; if anything, this graph suggests they are one of the less-valued financial occupations.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the graph’s salary information does not directly contest the passage’s purpose of comparing automated and human accountants.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because salary information as a whole is irrelevant to the passage, and incorporating more detailed salary information would not make it relevant."
26,A,4,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms",,"Choice A is best. The purpose of this sentence is to introduce the idea that software is not plagued by human error. The correct idiom to express this is “subject to.”</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because software is a singular noun and is thus inconsistent with “subjects” as plural.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “subject from” is the incorrect idiom to describe something more likely to have a certain quality.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because although the idiom is correct in this case, the sentence is primarily in the present tense and so the past tense use of “subjected” is incorrect."
27,C,3,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms",False Comparisons,"Choice C is best. “​Accountants” is plural, and so we need to have “bookkeepers” plural to maintain tense agreement in the sentence’s comparison.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “bookkeeper” is singular and does not properly agree with the plural “accountants.”</br>It’s NOT Choice B because “solely” is redundant and implies bookkeeping is the only responsibility of accountants.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because although “to be” could work in place of “as,” it is an unnecessary change. More importantly, “accountants” is plural and “bookkeeper” is singular, so there is still tense disagreement."
28,B,4,Writing Quality Enhancement,,"Choice B is best. Sentence 6 expresses the idea that while human accountants have always been the main form of bookkeeping in the past, they are increasingly being replaced by accounting software. Because the paragraph mostly focuses on this new kind of software, the sentence is best placed right at the transition between human and virtual accountants, which is after sentence 1.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because sentence 6 does not conclusively end the paragraph. Insteads, it contains a “however” statement after a full paragraph of information supporting the stance within the sentence. Only if “however” were swapped with a transition like “therefore” would this placement make sense.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because sentence 6 would interrupt the flow of discussion about transactions and accounting software.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because this would interrupt the ongoing discussion of accounting software and online bookkeeping."
29,B,5,Writing Quality Enhancement,Clauses and Independence,"Choice B is best. T​his sentence focuses on a counterargument that software actually presents more errors than expected, so the shift to technology is not necessarily better. Hence, the most appropriate transition in this case should be “maintaining,” which reflects the idea that continuing to support the older style of bookkeeping is okay too.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “such” used in this context is grammatically incorrect, the phrase “such that” can usually be substituted with “so that” in a sentence to check for grammatical correctness. Here, “so that” does not sufficiently link proponents of accountants to their argument.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “which is” preceded by a comma is normally utilized to introduce new information or a definition. Here, the argument in favor of human accounting has been implied and described throughout the passage, so “maintaining” is more appropriate.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because while the transition is grammatically correct, the mention of “their opinion” is redundant and not the ideal transition."
30,B,5,Writing Quality Enhancement,Phrases,"Choice B is best. This sentence contains a subordinate clause followed by an independent clause, which must be separated by a comma.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because a semicolon cannot be used to separate a subordinate or dependent clause from an independent clause.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “because software categorizes automatically” is not an independent clause and cannot stand on its own.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “therefore” is redundant and extraneous."
31,B,2,Adverb Usage,,"Choice B is best. This sentence reiterates the idea that was introduced in the final sentence of the previous paragraph — that software has automation benefits but cannot be used to make non-programmable decisions. “In other words” is the only transition that expresses the intention of rewording and expanding upon this idea.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “in spite of this” is a transitional phrase that introduces a contrasting topic, which is not the case here.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “consequently” is a summarizing transition word, which is not the intent here.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “as a result” is another summarizing transition word, and the goal of this sentence is to restate an idea with additional support."
32,D,4,Parallel Structure,,"Choice D is best. ​This sentence expresses how accountants are able to distinguish between two entities better than software. The verb “distinguish” applies to both “names” and “correct categories,” and it only needs to be used once.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the second usage of “distinguish” is redundant.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the insertion of another verb, “identify,” interrupts the two aspects that are compared through “between.”</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the second usage of “between” is redundant."
33,D,4,Writing Quality Enhancement,,"Choice D is b​est​.​The main idea of the paragraph is that while virtual accounting has many benefits, there are also setbacks, which include transaction errors due to miscategorization. Choice D supports this idea by explaining one possible consequence companies may face if they rely exclusively on bookkeeping software.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because details about required authorization forms do not directly support how human accountants can better tackle bookkeeping than computers.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the main idea of this paragraph is not about integrating human and software accounting for greater success.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the main focus of this passage as a whole is accountants, not other members of the finance department ."
34,B,2,Adverb Usage,,"Choice B is b​est​. T​he purpose of this sentence is to show that Israeli systems are not as chemically intensive to clean as other systems. “However” is the appropriate contrasting transition word in this case.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because this sentence is introducing a contrast, so an addition transition word such as “furthermore” is incorrect.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because this sentence is describing a contrast and “concurrently” is better used to express the idea of two events happening at the same time.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the goal of this sentence is to show a contrast, so a chronological transition word like “accordingly” is incorrect."
35,D,4,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms",,"Choice D is b​est​. ​Recognize that ​​the only difference between the answer choices is with the first verb. “Sought” most cleanly and precisely summarizes what the scientists intended to do in this case.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “attempted to find” is needlessly wordy.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because it makes more sense for one to “strive” to achieve something, such as “strive ​to find”​ a technology instead of merely striving​ for ​a technology.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because although it conveys the same idea, “searched for” is slightly more wordy than “sought.”"
36,A,3,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms",,"Choice A is ​best​. T​he previous sentence describes a proposition for an innovation that would introduce a new cleaning process. This proposition is best described as a change in method, which represents a modification.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “deformation” implies a kind of misshaping or distortion, which has a negative connotation and is not the case here.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “affliction” generally describes a malady that causes pain or suffering, which is not appropriate here.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “mutilation” is synonymous with some sort of damage, which is not implied here."
37,A,3,Subject-Verb Agreement,Parallel Structure,"Choice A is ​best​. R​ecognize that the object being described here is “pathway,” which is a singular noun. Hence, the correct verb tense of trap should be the singular “traps.”</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “trap” and “accelerate” are both plural verbs that do not agree with “pathway” as a singular object.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice C because while “accelerates” is properly conjugated, “trap” is a plural form of the verb while the object “pathway” is singular.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice D because “has trapped” is in the past tense and the sentence is in the present tense."
38,D,5,Unclear Sentences,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms",Choice D is b​est​. ​“Specifically designed” implies that the drains were especially made for a purpose. The underlined portion can be deleted since it is redundant.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “specifically designed” and “constructed for this purpose” are redundant.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because “specifically designed” and “built for this use” are redundant.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “specifically designed” and “intended for this function” are redundant.
39,B,5,Writing Quality Enhancement,,"Choice B is b​est​. C​ontext is key here.The following sentence describes a multi-site, national research experiment, so the topic sentence of this paragraph ought to introduce this testing. Choice B offers the best transition from the description of herringbone drains in the previous paragraph to their implementation in a larger scientific setting.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because this sentence presents an ambiguous transition, and the use of “validated” in a scientific context does not represent the manifestation of an idea into an experiment.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because while tempting, this sentence does not adequately introduce the “experimentation” that is discussed in the subsequent sentence.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because immediately characterizing the drains as a solution does not logically flow with describing the “experimentation” that is discussed in the subsequent sentence."
40,D,4,Phrases,Clauses and Independence,"Choice D is b​est​. ​In this sentence, “or a water filtration system that remains pure” is a phrase that is used to define “chemical freedom,” and thus it should be surrounded by commas.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because this phrase is missing the comma before “or.”</br>It’s NOT Choice B because this phrase is missing the first comma before “or” and the second comma is not placed at the full conclusion of the descriptive phrase.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the commas enclose a phrase that is an incomplete subset of the bigger descriptor of chemical freedom."
41,A,4,Writing Quality Enhancement,,"Choice A is ​best​. I​n the second sentence, the author notes that the field experiments were done “at a fifth of the cost at which they could have done so alone.” This information by itself is rather ambiguous, and the suggested additional phrase helps clarify why partnering with the Ministry offered practical benefit.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because while the phrase should be added, the previous paragraph d​id​mention that their experimentation took place on a “small, micro-desalination” level, negating the validity of the second half of this answer.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the additional information does not shift the focus of the content.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the additional information is not stated in any other part of the sentence."
42,D,5,Verb Tenses,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms","Choice D is b​est​. ​The topic sentence describes how these tests “allowed” the scientists to validate their technology. The structure of the experiment enabling the a​bility ​to analyze desalination potential is key here.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “assessed” by itself does not encapsulate the idea that these tests gave the scientists the ability to study replicability.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because “could” is speculative, and we know that the scientists actually assessed their technology via these tests.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “were assessing” indicates a past ongoing event, but this sentence is describing an experiment with a finite time period and conclusive end point."
43,A,4,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms",,"Choice A is ​best​. T​he goal of the scientists was to find a natural cleaning technique that eliminated the need for costly chemical cleaning. “Naturally purified” best reflects this aim.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “desalinated” could have been achieved by a number of processes; it does not adequately specify that the process was natural.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “microorganism-influenced” does not rule out an unnatural source of desalination.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “filter-generated” does not address the scientists’ goal to find a non-chemical, natural desalination process."
44,C,5,Phrases,Clauses and Independence,Choice C is ​best​. N​o comma is necessary to separate “for filtering other minerals out of seawater and other naturally occurring liquids” from the rest of the sentence. It is an essential detail in this case and is not removable from the sentence.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the comma between “techniques” and “for” only serves to interrupt the flow of the statement and does not actually separate two clauses.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the commas are placed incorrectly and are extraneous.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the commas are placed incorrectly and are extraneous.
