5,"D",2,"Writing Quality Enhancement","","Choice D is best. The phrase “2 million midsize vehicles” accurately reflects the graph and demonstrates the small amount of vehicles that the author is claiming were “just” bought by American consumers from 2013-2017. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because while 6 million small SUVs, while accurately reflecting the graph, is a large number of vehicles compared to the 2 million midsize vehicles</br>It’s NOT Choice B because later on the sentence discusses “8 million small sedans”, making this choice repetitive.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because a later sentence in the paragraph discusses “three times as many impractical, inefficient sports cars”"
6,"A",3,"Writing Quality Enhancement","","Choice A is best. The graph demonstrates how around 13 million pickup trucks were sold, making it the most sold car within the data. Therefore, “more pickup trucks” were “purchased than any other vehicle type”.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because the graph demonstrates how fewer sports cars and midsize vehicles were sold compared to large sedans.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the correct answer in Question 5 already references midsize vehicles. So while fewer midsize vehicles were in fact sold according to the graph, including that detail here would be unnecessarily repetitive.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the graph demonstrates how fewer midsize vehicles were sold compared to sports cars."
7,"B",3,"Homophones","","Choice B is best. “Worse than” implies a comparison and does not contain the unnecessary comma separation (a comma would only be necessary without the connecting “than” statement).</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “then” refers to a progression of time and the usage of the comma is incorrect as it would have to be followed by the subject “the low sales” as opposed to “then the low sales”</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “then” refers to a progression of time.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because  comma is incorrect as it would have to be followed by the subject “the low sales” as opposed to “than the low sales”"
8,"C",1,"Verb Tenses","","Choice C is best. “Enlarge” is in the present tense and is the correct tense for the plural subject of “small and large SUVs”.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “enlarges” would be the singular present tense, we are talking about many varied SUVs.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because “are enlarging” is in the present continuous tense, and “enlarge” should be in the present tense to maintain parallel structure with “has…(impact)”</br>It’s NOT Choice D “have enlarged” is in the present perfect progressive tense and we want to maintain parallel structure"

11,"A",3,"Clauses and Independence","","Choice A is best. “Or” describes the difference between the two decisions that the readers can take</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “and” would erroneously suggest that readers do both actions, which would be illogical</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “nor” would mean that readers do not trade in their vehicles for more eco-friendly cars</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “but” suggests contrast"
12,"A",4,"Writing Quality Enhancement","","Choice A is best. “orange, blue, and green.” correctly lists the three colors and separates the two independent sentences.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because having a semicolon followed by “in addition” is poor writing as “in addition” usually introduces an independent sentence.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because having a semicolon followed by “in other words” is grammatically poor as “in other words” would also be used to introduce another sentence.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “is” is singular while “colors” later on in the sentence is a plural subject"
13,"D",3,"Phrases","Clauses and Independence","Choice D is best. “covered with massive painted murals” correctly describes the mural and posters.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “covered with massive, painted, murals” would suggest a list</br>It’s NOT Choice B because “covered, with massive painted murals,” is grammatically incorrect because it is now unclear as to what the buildings are covered with</br>It’s NOT Choice C because  “covered with massive painted murals-“ would require a closing hyphen later on in the sentence"
14,"C",5,"Phrases","Unclear Sentences","Choice C is best. The answer effectively provides a possible, detailed description</br>of the human pyramid being used for military intimidation</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because describing the color of the pyramid is irrelevant to potential military application</br>It’s NOT Choice B because simply describing what the pyramid was potentially called does not complete the explanation of the acts origins</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the paragraph begins by introducing a agreed upon location or origin"
15,"C",3,"Writing Quality Enhancement","","Choice C is best. The sentence best concludes the paragraph by addressing the debate regarding its origins but also introducing its application today.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the sentence does not conclude the paragraph as it only introduces previously unknown information.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because this sentence would be a very poor way to end the paragraph as it understates the pyramids’ historical and present popularity.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because this sentence would suggest that more information will follow regarding the pyramids’ present value."
16,"A",2,"Pronouns and Noun Substitutes","","Choice A is best. “both of whom” correctly creates the subject of that independent Clause</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “both” is not the correct grammatical subject for the independent clause</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “of which both” suggests objects, not individuals</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “both of them” is not the correct grammatical subject for the independent clause"

18,"B",2,"Writing Quality Enhancement","","Choice B is best. “to represent Krishna’s humble origins” best describes the simplicity of the pot due to the adjective “humble”</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “a clay pot” does not necessarily directly relate to the simplicity of the pot nor is there a direct symbolic comparison</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “from Indian Mythology” does not relate to simplicity</br>It’s NOT Choice D because  “for symbolic reasons” is vague and too explicit"
19,"A",4,"Writing Quality Enhancement","","Choice A is best. Sentence 5 parallels the structure and content of sentence 4 by describing the symbolic nature of the dairy products. Furthermore, sentence 6 further elaborates on the significance of this produce in its spiritual and historical context</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because it would then interrupt the flow of sentences describing the physical appearance of the pot.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because these sentences flow naturally as they are, discussing different types of milk in the pot.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the content has moved on to the relationship of the products to Krishna"
20,"B",3,"Apostrophes and Contractions","Pronouns and Noun Substitutes","Choice B is best. “Its” correctly refers to the relationship between the game and the culmination</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “it’s” is “it is” which would be grammatically incorrect in this sentence.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “there” refers to a location</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “their” is plural while the subject that its referring to, “game”, is singular"

22,"D",4,"Writing Quality Enhancement","","Choice D is best. “milk” is concise, grammatically correct, and correctly describes what occurs in this tradition.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because it is obvious that he will not drink the milk if he pours it out and is therefore unnecessarily long</br>It’s NOT Choice B because it contains unnecessary details regarding the milk</br>It’s NOT Choice C because  it is obvious that the pot had the milk in it and is therefore unnecessarily long"
23,"A",4,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms","","Choice A is best. We want to find a word that conveys the degree of precision and dedication these accountants show for their work. “Meticulous” is the most appropriate choice that accomplishes this tone. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “super-precise” lacks the timeliness aspect of the accountants’ work. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because “on-the-dot” is needlessly wordy</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “fierce” does not convey the tone of being precise and detailed."
24,"C",4,"Parallel Structure","","Choice C is best. The sentence conveys the meaning that accountants keep three different records: notes, expenses, and transactions. Hence, we merely need a comma to separate “expenses” from the other two types of records. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because a semicolon can only be used to separate two independent clauses. The phrase after the semicolon is not an independent clause. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because a semicolon can only be used to separate two independent clauses. “Expenses” is not a clause. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because we need a comma to separate out “expenses” from the other items in the list."
25,"C",3,"Writing Quality Enhancement","","Choice C is best. The graph introduces information about the salaries of accountants as  compared to that of other occupations. The overall purpose of this passage is to compare human and software accountants, and hence, this graph presents information that is not relevant to the focus of the passage.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the graph does not supply relevant information, and even looking at the data shown accountants make less than the median for financial occupations, if anything this graph would say they are one of the less valued financial occupations</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the graph presents salary information that isn’t directly relevant to the passage’s purpose comparing automated and human accountants, and provides no counterargument.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the graph should not be added here because it presents irrelevant information, not because it excludes pay scale information for a specific group."
26,"A",4,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms","","Choice A is best. The purpose of this sentence is to introduce the idea that software is not plagued by human error. The correct idiom to express this is “subject to”.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because software is a singular noun and so is inconsistent with “subjects” as a plural noun. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because “subject from” is the incorrect idiom to describe something more likely to have a certain quality.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because although the idiom is correct in this case, the tense of the sentence is primarily in present tense and so “subjected” is in the wrong tense."
27,"C",3,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms","False Comparisons","Choice C is best. “Accountants” is plural, and so we need to have “bookkeepers” to keep the tense agreement. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “accountants” is plural and “bookkeeper” is singular, so there is tense disagreement in this case. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because “solely” is redundant and also implies bookkeeping is their only job</br>It’s NOT Choice D because although “to be” could work in place of as, it is an unnecessary change. More importantly,  “accountants” is plural and “bookkeeper” is singular, so there is still tense disagreement."
28,"B",4,"Writing Quality Enhancement","","Choice B is best. Sentence 6 expresses the idea that while human accountants had always been the main form of bookkeeping in the past, they are increasingly being replaced by accounting software. Because the paragraph mostly focuses on this new kind of accounting software, the sentence needs to be placed right at the transition between human and virtual accountants, which is after sentence 1.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because sentence 6 does not make much sense as a way to end the paragraph, it contains a “however” statement after a full paragraph of information supporting the stance stated within the sentence, if it started with “therefore” it might make sense here. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because sentence 6 would interrupt the flow of discussion about transactions and accounting software </br>It’s NOT Choice D because this would interrupt the ongoing discussion of accounting software and online bookkeeping."
29,"B",5,"Writing Quality Enhancement","Clauses and Independence","Choice B is best. This sentence focuses on a counterargument that software actually presents more errors than expected, so change is not necessarily better. Hence, the most appropriate transition in this case should be “maintaining”, since the argument is that the current use of human accountants is ok too. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “such” used in this context is grammatically incorrect, the phrase “such that” can usually be replaced with “so that” in a sentence to check for grammatical correctness. Here, “so that” does not sufficiently link proponents of accountants to their argument.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “which is” would point to their specific argument as opposed to a supporting component. The inverse of the argument for software accounting is the argument for human accounting, the supporting sub-argument that mistakes increase with software usage is a position that is “maintained” to support the inverse position.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because while the transition is grammatically correct in this case, the mention of “their opinion” may be redundant and is not the ideal transition."
30,"B",5,"Writing Quality Enhancement","Phrases","Choice B is best. This sentence contains a subordinate clause followed by an independent clause, and so must be separated by a comma.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because a semicolon cannot be used to separate a subordinate/dependent clause from an independent clause. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because “because software categorizes automatically” is not an independent clause and cannot stand on its own. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because “therefore” is redundant and extraneous in this case."
31,"B",2,"Adverb Usage","","Choice B is best. This sentence reiterates an idea that was introduced in the previous paragraph, that software has automation pros but cannot be used to make non-programmable decisions. “In other words” is the only transition that expresses this tone.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “in spite of this” is a transition word that introduces a contrasting topic, which is not the case here.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “consequently” is a summarizing transition word, which is not the intent here.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “as a result” is another summarizing transition word, where the goal of this sentence is to restate an idea with additional support."
32,"D",4,"Parallel Structure","","Choice D is best. The sentence expresses the idea that accountants are able to distinguish between two entities. Choice “D” is the only choice that directly maintains the comparison “between” the names and the categories. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the second usage of “distinguish” is redundant. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because “identify” interrupts the introduction of the two aspects that are compared through “between”. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because the second usage of “between” is redundant."
33,"D",4,"Writing Quality Enhancement","","Choice D is best. The main idea of the passage is that while virtual accounting has lots of pros, there are also still setbacks that include transaction errors. Choice D shows an example of how human accounting can correct errors better than automated accounting.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the main idea is not to support the idea that virtual accounting’s cons includes additional levels of authorizations.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the main idea is not to support the idea of human accounting being integrated with virtual accounting for success. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because the main idea is not to support the idea that virtual accounting’s cons include its role in disrupting the management structure of the industry."
34,"B",2,"Adverb Usage","","Choice B is best. The main purpose of this sentence is to show that Israeli systems are not as chemically intensive to clean as other systems might be. “However” is the appropriate contrasting transition in this case.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because this sentence is showing a contrast, so an addition transition word such as “furthermore” is not correct.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because this sentence is describing a contrast, where “concurrently” would be used to express the idea of two events happening at the same time.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because the goal of this sentence is to show a contrast, so a chronological transition word such as “accordingly” is not correct."
35,"D",4,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms","","Choice D is best. “Sought” most cleanly and precisely summarizes what the scientists intended to do in this case.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because “attempted to find” is needlessly wordy.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because it makes more sense for one to “strive to find” (which would still be wordy) a technology instead of merely striving for a technology.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “searched for” is slightly more wordy than “sought,” while conveying the same idea."
36,"A",3,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms","","Choice A is best. The previous sentence described a proposition for an innovation that would introduce a new cleaning process. This is best described as a change in methods, which is a modification. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “deformation” implies a kind of misshaping or distortion, which is not the case here. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because “affliction” describes something that causes pain or suffering, which is not implied here.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “mutilation” is synonymous with some sort of damage, which is not implied here. "
37,"A",3,"Subject-Verb Agreement","Parallel Structure","Choice A is best. The subject here is modification, which is a singular noun. Hence, the correct verb tense of trap should be “traps”, which is also singular. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “trap” cannot be used here since it is plural while the subject is singular, the same is true for “accelerate”.</br>It’s NOT Choice C here “accelerates” is in the correct form, but  “trap” cannot be used here since it is plural and the subject is singular. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because “has trapped” is in the past tense and the sentence is in the present tense. "
38,"D",5,"Unclear Sentences","Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms","Choice D is best. “Specifically designed” implies that the drains were especially made for a purpose. The underlined portion should be deleted since it is redundant.</br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because it redundant and its meaning is already expressed via the introduction, “specifically designed”. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because it redundant and its meaning is already expressed via the introduction, “specifically designed”. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because it redundant and its meaning is already expressed via the introduction, “specifically designed”."
39,"B",5,"Writing Quality Enhancement","","Choice B is best. The sentence after sentence 39 describes a multi-site research experiment; hence, choice B is the best transition from herringbone drains to their implementation in a larger setting. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because it does not tie as well in with the subsequent discussion of moving the drains to a larger setting for testing. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because it does not address the “experimentation” that is discussed in the subsequent sentence. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because it does not address the “experimentation” that is discussed in the subsequent sentence."
40,"D",4,"Phrases","Clauses and Independence","Choice D is best. In this sentence, “or a water filtration system that remains pure” is a phrase that is used to describe chemical freedom, and so should be surrounded by commas. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because it is missing a comma before “or”. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because the commas are not placed in the correct places.</br>It’s NOT Choice C because the commas enclose a phrase that is an incomplete subset of the bigger descriptor of chemical freedom."
41,"A",4,"Writing Quality Enhancement","","Choice A is best. The added phrase helps elaborate on why testing with the Ministry provides them with added benefit. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because while the phrase should be added, its purpose is to provide an additional reason for why Ministry testing is a good idea, not to discuss gaps in the previous work of the scientists. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because the addition does not shift the focus away from the topic. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because the addition is not stated previously in other parts of the sentence."
42,"D",5,"Verb Tenses","Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms","Choice D is best. The previous sentence suggests that these tests gave scientists the ability to validate their technology. Hence, Choice D is the best choice since it includes a part that describes how the scientists “were able” to then assess their technology in a larger setting. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because it does not transition as well from the previous setting where the tests gave the scientists an ability. </br>It’s NOT Choice B because “could” is speculative, and we know that the scientists actually assessed their technology via these tests. </br>It’s NOT Choice C because this assessing occuring in the past and is not ongoing in the past."
43,"A",4,"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms","","Choice A is best. The goal of the scientists was to find a natural cleaning technique. Hence, “naturally purified” is the best description in this case. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice B because “desalinated” could have been by any number of processes, it does not specify that the process was natural</br>It’s NOT Choice C because “microorganism-influenced” does not rule out an unnatural source of desalination.</br>It’s NOT Choice D because “filter-generated” does not address the scientists’ goal to find a non-chemical, natural desalination process."
44,"C",5,"Phrases","Clauses and Independence","Choice C is best. No comma is necessary here to separate “for filtering other minerals out of seawater or other naturally occurring liquids” from the rest of the sentence. It is an essential detail in this case and should not be removable. </br></br>It’s NOT Choice A because the comma between “techniques” and “for” only serves to break up the flow of the statement and does not actually separate two clauses.</br>It’s NOT Choice B because the commas are placed incorrectly and are extraneous. </br>It’s NOT Choice D because the commas are placed incorrectly and are extraneous."
