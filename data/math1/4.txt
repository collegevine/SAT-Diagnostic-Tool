<b>Choice C is correct.</b> We know that supplementary angles must add up to \(180°\), so \(∠QLT =180°-100°=80°\). We also know that the angles in a triangle must add up to \(180°\), and vertical angles (angles across from one another) must be equal, thus \(∠QLT=∠MNT=60°\). Lastly, if the sides \(LS\) and \(LT\) are congruent, triangle \(LST\) must be an isosceles triangle, which means \(∠S=∠T\) and that \(∠T=\frac{180°-100°}{2}=40°\). To complete the angles of the triangle, \(r=180°-60°-40°=80°\).
