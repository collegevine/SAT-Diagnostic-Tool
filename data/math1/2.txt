<b>Choice A is correct.</b> We simply need to write an equation in the form \( y = mx + b \), where \(m\) is the slope (\( \frac{rise}{run}) \) and \(b\) is the y-intercept. Because the line intersects the y-axis at the origin, \(b=0\). From the highlighted points \(â€”(1,3)\) and \((2,6)\), we can determine that \(rise = 3\) and \(run = 1\), which means the slope is just \(\frac{3}{1}=3\). Thus, the equation of this line is \(y=3x\), or to substitute in the axes labels, \(k=3m\).
