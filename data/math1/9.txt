<b>Choice A is correct.</b> Recall that \((x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2\) is the equation of a circle, where \((h,k)\) is the center and \(r\) is the radius. Therefore, given the equation \((x-4)^2+(y-3)^2=9\), we know that the center is \((4,3)\) and the radius is \(3\). You could always draw a diagram to better visualize this circle, but you could also quickly recognize point \(M\), given as \((4,0)\), is directly below the center of the circle at \((4,3)\). If \(\overline{MD}\) is a diameter, then point \(D\) must be directly above the center at point \((4,y)\). The radius is known to be \(3\), so \(D\) must be at \((4,3+3)\), or \((4,6)\).
