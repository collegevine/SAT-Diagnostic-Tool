<b>Choice C is correct.</b> If we define \(x\) as the number of containers that hold 4 balls and \(y\) as the number of containers that hold 6 balls, we can create a system of equations: $$ x+y=30 $$ and $$ 4x+6y=168 $$
</br>
To solve for \(x\), use the substitution method:
</br>
Rearrange the first equation to define \(y\) in terms of \(x\): $$ y=30-x $$
Substitute \(30-x\) in for \(y\): $$ 4x+6(30-x)=168 $$
Multiply out the parentheses: $$ 4x+180-6x=168 $$
Combine like terms & isolate \(x\): $$ −2x=−12 \implies x=12 $$
