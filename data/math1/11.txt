<b>Choice B is correct.</b> Recognize that this graph has zeroes at \(x=−2\), \(x=1\), and \(x=3\), and that the line crosses the x-axis at each of its roots. From this information, we know that the equation is just \(y=(x+2)(x-1)(x-3)\).

<i>Note: if the line had “bounced” at any of its zeroes, then the factor for that particular root would be \((x-root)^2\).</i>
