<b>Choice C is correct.</b> If landline usage dropped at a constant rate during this period, there must be a linear relationship between time and the use of landlines. After glancing at the answer choices, we know the y-intercept is 60. Thus, we just need to find the slope (\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\).

From the information given, we can derive two points: (2005, 60) and (2014, 32). Using the slope equation, the slope is equal to \(\frac{32-60}{2014-2005}=frac{-28}{9}\). Finally, combine terms to produce the final function: \(U(t) =âˆ’\frac{28}{9}t+60\).
