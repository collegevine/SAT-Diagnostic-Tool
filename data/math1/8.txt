<b>Choice C is correct.</b> Glancing at the answer choices, we know that here, we only need to factor each expression rather than performing long/synthetic division.
</br>
</br>
Begin with \(k(x)\), since itâ€™s merely a quadratic and thus more friendly: $$ \frac{h(x)}{k(x)}=\frac{x^3-4x}{x^2+2x-8}=\frac{x^3-4x}{(x+4)(x-2)} $$
We now know that we want to factor out either \((x+4)\) or \((x-2)\) from \(h(x)\), so we start by doing what we can to remove the \(4\) from \(4x\): $$ \frac{x^3-4x}{(x+4)(x-2)}=\frac{x(x^2-4)}{(x+4)(x-2)}\) $$
We know that expressions in the form \((a^2-b^2)\) factor out to \((a+b)(a-b)\): $$ \frac{x(x^2-4)}{(x+4)(x-2)}=\frac{x(x+2)(x-2)}{(x+4)(x-2)} $$
Simplify \((x-2)\) out of both equations: $$ \frac{x(x+2)}{(x+4)} $$
</br>
When cancelling \((x-2)\), remember it is there in the original equation, because when \((x-2)=0\), the original equation becomes undefined. Thus, \(\frac{x(x+2)}{(x+4)}=\frac{x^3-4x}{x^2+2x-8}\) as long as \( x \neq 2 \).
