<b>Choice C is correct.</b> To find all of the solutions, assume that the equations share at least one. This means that you should be able to substitute the first equation into the second.

Substitute \(x^2-6x+1\) for \(y\): $$ x^2-6x+1+2x=âˆ’3 $$
Combine terms and set the equation equal to 0: $$ x^2-4x+4 $$
Factor: $$(x-2)^2 \implies x=2 $$
