108 is correct.
∠l is a central angle (formed at the center of the circle by two radii), and its measure corresponds to the minor arc formed by the same radii, arc \(SP\).
If the length of the arc \(SP\) is \(\frac{3}{10}\) of the circumference, the degree measure of the arc must also be \(\frac{3}{10}\) of the entire circle’s degrees.
Since we know that circles measure 360°,the measure of this arc is \(\frac{3}{10} \times 360°=108°\), which is also the measure of the central angle \(∠l\).
