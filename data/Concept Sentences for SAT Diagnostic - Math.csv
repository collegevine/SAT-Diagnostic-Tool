Concept,Text
Definition of Functions,"Defining functions is the single most important skill to master if you want to do well on the SAT, and the SAT really tries to test you on the concept from every different angle. In particular, you're going to have to master the ability to pull functions and their corresponding numbers out of word problems. "
Properties of Integers,"The properties of integers are pretty foundational concepts that underpin a lot of math techniques, so if you shore this up, it will pay dividends for many other types of questions. "
Statistics,"The SAT has really ramped up its testing of basic statistical concepts, particularly looking at ""real-world"" datasets that are used to test the basics of mean, median, and mode. One thing you should watch out for on these types of questions is whether the numbers are out of order â€” the SAT writers will try to trick you with that. "
Equation of a Line,"The questions that involve the equation of a line are mainly testing slope-intercept format, so if you've got limited time, you should focus on mastering that before working on point-slope format. "
System of Equations,The systems of equations questions on the SAT tend to involve relatively simple math but the complexity usually comes from having to generate a system of equations from a paragraph of text in a word problem.
Angles & Lines,"Angle and line questions overwhelmingly come in the form of two sets of parallel lines that intersect with each other, so you should make sure to brush up on the rules surrounding angles at intersections. "
Complex Equations,"Complex equations are probably the most advanced math concept tested on the SAT, so the main thing you'll need to do is master the basics. "
Exponents,"The more complicated exponent questions on the SAT tend to involve factoring, so you should look to master that specifically. "
Circles,"The SAT tends to ask a lot of questions about circles with inscribed angles, so you should pay special attention to those types of questionsas you practice. "
Compound Change,"The SAT asks a lot of questions about financial interest rates and bank accounts when testing compound change, so you should make sure you're comfortable pulling interest rates and principles out of word problems with a financial theme. "
Polynomials,"Polynomials are rarely tested with word problems, so mastering the basics around factoring and multiplication of polynomials will go a long way towards shoring up the concept. "
Quadratic Equations,"The SAT tends to prefer whole numbers or simple fractions as the answers to its questions, so you will rarely be asked to use the quadratic formula to solve quadratic equations. You should spend your time practicing how to solve these types of problems with factoring. "
Systems of Inequalities,"Systems of inequalities on the SAT tend to be less complex than systems of equations, so your focus when you prep should be on drilling the fundamentals and practicing a bunch of straightforward problems. "
"Factors, Multiples & Divisibility","Factors, multiples, and divisbility are pretty basic arithmetic rules, so there's not really any substitute for just memorizing the rules. "
Interior Angles of a Polygon,"Questions about the interior angles of a polygon will never ask you to remember anything larger than a hexagon, so if you can memorize the interior angles for pentagons and hexagons (and rectangles/triangles), you can save some time on these questions. That being said, it's still worth remembering the formula for the interior angles for an n-sided polygon [(n-2) * 180]/n. "
Multiplying Polynomials,"Polynomials are rarely tested with word problems, so mastering the basics around factoring and multiplication of polynomials will go a long way towards shoring up the concept. "
Parallel & Perpendicular Lines,"In addition to studying the direct rules around parallel and perpendicular lines, you should also make sure to brush up on the angle rules for intersecting parallel lines as there are a lot of questions that cover that. "
Percent Change,"Percent change questions on the SAT are almost always in word problem format, so you should focus on building up the ability to pull numbers out of word problems. "
Reciprocals,"Problems involving reciprocals tend to involve relatively basic arithmetic, so you should focus on memorizing the rules. "
"Sin, Cos, & Tan","Most trigonometry problems on the SAT have to do with triangles, so its more important to master the Pythagorean identities than the unit circle. "
Symmetry in Functions,"Symmetry in functions is one of the more complicated concepts covered on the SAT, so you may need to spend some extra time mastering odd and even functions. "
Triangles,"A lot of triangle problems involve Pythagorean triples, so you should memorize the common ones (3/4/5, 5/12/13, 8/15/17, 7/24/25) so that you can save time on these types of questions. "
