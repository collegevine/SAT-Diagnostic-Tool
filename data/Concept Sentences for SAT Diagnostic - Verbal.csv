Concept,Text
Historical Passages,"Historical passages are sometimes difficult because the English they use is often older and archaic. So if you're struggling with these types of passages, you can try looking up historical speeches with the modern English side by side to improve your comprehension."
Science Passages,One mistake you'll want to try to avoid on science passages is to get caught up in the jargon. The SAT isn't trying to test your scientific knowledge - these passages are still meant to be reading comprehension
Writing Quality Enhancement,"Unlike many of the grammar concepts, writing quality enhancement isn't always rule based, but one thing that the SAT always prioritizes is conciseness. When you're stuck between a couple of answer choices, the more concise one is usually the right one. The other technique you can try with writing quality enhancement questions is to say the sentence out loud (softly) to yourself to see which answer sounds the best. "
Social Science Passages,"Social science passages tend to be the most straightforward, in part because they are rarely translated from other languages or written in older English. The flip side of this is that the SAT tends to ask deeper and more complex interpretation questions with these passages. As you prep, you should practice stating the main idea of each passage and ideally each paragraph to get comfortable with these types of interpretation questions."
Dual Passage,"The biggest mistake you can make on dual passage sections is to treat the two passages as one long passage. Instead, you should focus on each passage separately and answer the questions that pertain to only one passage first. Then after you've gotten through those questions, move on to the ones that involve both passages."
Literature Passages,"Literature passages have a similar problem as historical passages in that many of them are either translated from another language or written in an older style of English. One technique you can use to practice literature passages is to supplement your SAT prep with an AP Literature prep book, as the more difficult passages on that exam will put you in a great spot for literature passages on the SAT."
"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms",Idiom questions are one of the more frustrating types of questions on the SAT because there is no substitute for just memorizing them. 
Words in Context,"As you practice questions that ask about words in context, if you don't immediately know the definition of a word, one technique you can try is to restate the sentence in question using the defintions in the answer choices, then pick the answer that sounds best using that approach. "
Fact Recall,"With fact recall questions, the big thing to keep in mind is that the answer will always have direct support in the text "
Supporting Evidence,"Supporting evidence questions go hand in hand with fact recall questions, so you should practice these two types together - simply making sure that you always find the direct evidence in the passage for the fact recall questions will go a long way to shoring up your ability to deal with questions testing this concept."
Clauses and Independence,"The hardest questions that test clauses on the SAT tend to involve clauses that are presented out of order, so you should really focus on mastering unordered clauses as you prep. "
Phrases,"Phrase questions on the SAT tend to be pretty straightforward, so the biggest thing you can do is master the underlying skills through repetition - there are not shortcuts. "
Data Analysis,Data Analysis questions on the SAT verbal questions overwhelmingly involve graphs and ask you to either make comparisons between different data points (pie or bar graphs) or spot trends (line graphs). You should focus on these two skills (and three graph types) as you prep. 
Adverb Usage,"Adverb usage questions on the SAT tend to be very straightforward, so there are really no shortcuts. You have to memorize the rules. "
Parallel Structure,"Parallel structure questions on the SAT tend to be very straightforward, and involve the kind of error that you will often miss on your first time reading through a question. So if you don't see an error on your first read-through, you should specifically scan the text again for an error involving apostrophes/contractions, parallel structure, or false comparisons (the three types of errors that students most often miss on their first read through). "
Unclear Sentences,"Unclear sentence questions don't have as many firm rules, so one technique that you can try out if you're stuck is to say the sentence out loud under your breath and see if it sounds right. "
Author-Based Questions,"Author-based questions ask you to summarize key ideas from the passage (either the main idea or the idea of a particular portion of the passage), so you can improve your performance on these types of questions by writing out main ideas for the passage and each paragraph as you practice with passages. Once you've done this enough times, it will become much easier for you to direclty answer the author-based questions. "
Apostrophes and Contractions,"Apostrophes and contraction questions on the SAT tend to be very straightforward, and involve the kind of error that you will often miss on your first time reading through a question. So if you don't see an error on your first read-through, you should specifically scan the text again for an error involving apostrophes/contractions, parallel structure, or false comparisons (the three types of errors that students most often miss on their first read through). "
False Comparisons,"False comparison questions on the SAT tend to be very straightforward, and involve the kind of error that you will often miss on your first time reading through a question. So if you don't see an error on your first read-through, you should specifically scan the text again for an error involving apostrophes/contractions, parallel structure, or false comparisons (the three types of errors that students most often miss on their first read through). "
Homophones,"Homophone questions on the SAT tend to be pretty straightforward, so you should try to memorize the 5-8 most common homophones to save time on these types of questions. "
Objects vs. Subjects,"Object and subject questions on the SAT will often involve objects and subjects that are presented out of order, so one technique you can try out as you prep is to start by reordering the sentence so that is more clear before trying to answer the question."
Pronouns and Noun Substitutes,"Pronoun and noun substitute questions on the SAT tend to be very straightforward, so there are really no shortcuts. You have to memorize the rules. "
Subject-Verb Agreement,The hardest subject-verb agreement questions involve sentences where the subject and verb are out of order (verb-subject agreement). One technique you can try out as you prep is to start by reordering the sentence so that is more clear before trying to answer the question.
Verb Tenses,"Verb tense questions on the SAT verbal exam tend to be very straightforward, so there are really no shortcuts. You have to memorize the rules. "
