Historical Passages,"Historical passages are sometimes difficult because the English they use is often older and archaic. If you're struggling with these types of passages, you can try looking up historical speeches with the modern English side-by-side to improve your comprehension. "
Science Passages,One mistake you'll want to try to avoid on science passages is to get caught up in the jargon. The SAT isn't trying to test your scientific knowledge — these passages are still intended to test reading comprehension. 
Writing Quality Enhancement,"Unlike many of the grammar concepts, writing quality enhancement isn't always rule-based, but one thing that the SAT always prioritizes is conciseness. When you're stuck between a couple of answer choices, the more concise one is usually the right one. The other technique to try with writing quality enhancement questions is to say the sentence out loud (softly) to yourself to see which answer sounds the best. "
Social Science Passages,"Social science passages tend to be the most straightforward, in part because they are rarely translated from other languages or written in older English. The flip side of this is that the SAT tends to ask deeper and more complex interpretation questions with these passages. As you study, you should practice stating the main idea of each passage (and ideally each paragraph) to become comfortable with these types of interpretation questions. "
Dual Passage,"The biggest mistake you can make on dual passage sections is to treat the two passages as one long passage. Instead, you should focus on each passage separately and answer the questions that pertain to only one passage first. Then, after you've gotten through those questions, move on to the ones that involve both passages. "
Literature Passages,"Literature passages have a similar problem as historical passages in that many of them are either translated from another language or written in an older style of English. One technique you can use to practice literature passages is to supplement your SAT prep with an AP Literature prep book, as the more difficult passages on that exam will put you in a great spot for the SAT. "
"Repetition, Incorrect Words, and Idioms","Repeated ideas, phrases, and words are characteristic of writing that is not concise. Also be sure that every word in a sentence or phrase is a proper use of its definition — the SAT will occasionally substitute similar-looking or -sounding words to try and trick you. Idiom questions are one of the more frustrating types of questions on the SAT because there is no substitute for just memorizing them. "
Words in Context,"As you practice questions that ask about words in context, if you don't immediately know the definition of a word, one technique to try is restating the sentence in question using the defintions in the answer choices, then pick the answer that sounds best. "
Fact Recall,"With fact recall questions, the big thing to keep in mind is that the answer will always have direct support in the text. "
Supporting Evidence,"Supporting evidence questions go hand in hand with fact recall questions, so you should practice these two types together — simply make sure that you always find the direct evidence in the passage for the fact recall questions. "
Clauses & Independence,"Recognize which sentences or pieces of sentences have the subjects and verbs needed to stand alone, and which must be combined or re-arranged with other clauses for sentence clarity and completion. The hardest questions in this category tend to involve clauses that are presented out of order. "
Phrases,"Phrase questions on the SAT tend to be pretty straightforward, so the biggest thing you can do is master the underlying skills — subject agreement, prepositional phrases, participal phrases, parentheticals, etc. —  through repetition. There are no shortcuts. "
Data Analysis,Data analysis questions overwhelmingly involve graphs and ask you to either draw comparisons between different data points (pie or bar graphs) or recognize trends (line graphs). 
Adverb Usage,Adverb usage questions on the SAT tend to be very straightforward as they test your ability to distinguish between when a descriptor is describing a noun (adjective) and when a descriptor is describing a verb (adverb). 
Parallel Structure,"Parallel structure questions often reflect the kind of error missed on the first reading of a question. If you don't immediately see something wrong on your first read-through, you should specifically scan the text again for an error involving apostrophes and contractions, parallel structure, or false comparisons. For this category in particular, try to pinpoint small discrepancies in wording patterns. "
Unclear Sentences,"Unclear sentence questions don't have as many firm rules, so the best technique to utilize if you're stuck is to read the sentence aloud (quietly) and identify the choice that sounds correct to your ear. "
Author-Based Questions,Author-based questions ask you to recognize the intentions of the author and summarize key ideas from the passage (either the main idea or the idea of a particular portion of the passage). You can improve your performance on these types of questions by writing out the main ideas for the passage and individual paragraphs as you read. 
Apostrophes and Contractions,"Apostrophes and contractions tend to be very straightforward, and they involve the kind of error often missed on a first read-through. If you don't immediately recognize something as wrong in a sentence, specifically scan the text again for an error involving an improper combination of words or an incorrect apostrophe placement. "
False Comparisons,"False comparison questions involve the kind of error oftened miss on a first read-through. If you don't immediately recognize something as wrong on your first read-through of a sentence, specifically scan the text again for an error involving an incomplete comparison between two different classes of objects."
Homophones,"To master homophone questions, memorize the 5–8 most common homophones (or even more) to save time and move on quickly. "
Objects vs. Subjects,Object and subject questions will often involve sentences with objects and subjects presented out of order. One technique you can try as you study is to start by reordering the sentence so that is more clear before trying to answer the question. 
Pronouns & Noun Substitutes,Pronoun and noun substitute questions reflect straightforward mastery of grammar rules. There are no shortcuts.
Subject-Verb Agreement,The hardest subject-verb agreement questions involve sentences where the subject and verb are out of order (verb-subject agreement). One technique you can try out as you study is to start by reordering the sentence so that is more clear before trying to answer the question. 
Verb Tenses,"Verb tense questions on the SAT verbal exam tend to be very straightforward, so there are really no shortcuts. On each encounter, run through a mental checklist of agreements in plurality, consistency in tense, and parallelism within a sentence."
